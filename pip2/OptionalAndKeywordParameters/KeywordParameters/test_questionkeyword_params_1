   :answer_e: Runtime error since not enough values are passed in the call to f
   :feedback_a: 2 is bound to x, not z
   :feedback_b: 3 is the default value for y, not z
   :feedback_c: 5 is bound to y, not z
   :feedback_d: 2 is bound x, 5 to y, and z gets its default value, 7
   :feedback_e: z has a default value in the function definition, so it's optional to pass a value for it.
   :correct: d

   What value will be printed for z?

   .. code-block:: python

      initial = 7
      def f(x, y = 3, z = initial):
          print "x, y, z are:", x, y, z

      f(2, 5)
