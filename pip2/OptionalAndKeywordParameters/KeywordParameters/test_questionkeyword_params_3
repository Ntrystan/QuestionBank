   :answer_e: Runtime error since two different values are provided for x.
   :feedback_a: 2 is bound to x since it's the first value, but so is 5, based on keyword
   :feedback_b:
   :feedback_c: 5 is bound to x by keyword, but 2 is also bound to it by virtue of being the value and not having a keyword. In the online environment, it actually allows this, but not in a proper python interpreter.
   :feedback_d:
   :feedback_e: 2 is bound to x since it's the first value, but so is 5, based on keyword
   :correct: e

   What value will be printed for x?

   .. code-block:: python

      initial = 7
      def f(x, y = 3, z = initial):
          print "x, y, z are:", x, y, z

      f(2, x=5)
