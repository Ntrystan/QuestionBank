   :answer_e: Runtime error since no value is provided for y, which comes before z
   :feedback_a: 2 is bound to x, not y
   :feedback_b: 3 is the default value for y, and no value is specified for y,
   :feedback_c: say what?
   :feedback_d: 10 is the second value passed, but it is bound to z, not y.
   :feedback_e: That's the beauty of passing parameters with keywords; you can skip some parameters and they get their default values.
   :correct: b

   What value will be printed for y?

   .. code-block:: python

      initial = 7
      def f(x, y = 3, z = initial):
          print "x, y, z are:", x, y, z

      f(2, z = 10)
