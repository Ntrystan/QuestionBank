   Below is some code that assigns values to variables. Write code below it that makes it so that the variable ``x`` holds an integer value that is greater by 2 than the integer value it currently holds. That code should work no matter what the current value of ``x`` is! Then, write code that makes the variable ``apple`` hold the string value ``"television"``. Do not change any of the existing code.

   y = 5
   apple = 7
   x = 3
   pasta = "delicious"
