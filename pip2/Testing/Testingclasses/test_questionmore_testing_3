   :feedback_a: You want to check if maxabs returns the correct value for some input.

   To test the function maxabs, which kind of test case should you write?

   .. sourcecode:: python

      def maxabs(L):
         """L should be a list of numbers (ints or floats). The return value should be the maximum absolute value of the numbers in L."""
         return max(L, key = abs)
