   :answer_a: square
   :answer_b: g
   :answer_c: a number
   :feedback_a: Before executing square, it has to figure out what value to pass in, so g is executed first
   :feedback_b: g has to be executed and return a value in order to know what paramater value to provide to x.
   :feedback_c: square and g both have to execute before the number is printed.
   :correct: b

   Which will print out first, square, g, or a number?

   .. code-block:: python

       def square(x):
           print "square"
           return x*x

       def g(y):
           print "g"
           return y + 3

       print square(g(2))
