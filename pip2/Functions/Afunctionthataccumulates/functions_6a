   Rearrange the code statements to match the activecode window above. (This is an exercise in noticing where the indenting and outdenting happens, and where the return statement goes.)

   def mylen(x):
   =====
      c = 0 # initialize count variable to 0
   =====
      for y in x:
   =====
         c = c + 1   # increment the counter for each item in x
   =====
      return c
   =====
   print mylen("hello")
   print mylen([1, 2, 7])
