   :answer_e: Error: you can't nest function calls
   :feedback_a: Better read the section above one more time.
   :feedback_b: Better read the section above one more time.
   :feedback_c: That's h(2), but it is passed to g.
   :feedback_d: h(2) returns 7, so y is bound to 7 when g is invoked
   :feedback_e: Ah, but you can next function calls.
   :correct: d

   What will the following code output?

   .. code-block:: python

       def square(x):
           return x*x

       def g(y):
           return y + 3

       def h(y):
           return square(y) + 3

       print g(h(2))
