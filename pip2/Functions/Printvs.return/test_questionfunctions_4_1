   :answer_e: Error: y has a value but x is an unbound variable inside the square function
   :feedback_a: 2 is the input; the value returned from h is what will be printed
   :feedback_b: Don't forget that 2 gets squared.
   :feedback_c: First square 2, then add 3.
   :feedback_d: 3 is added to the result of squaring 2
   :feedback_e: When square is called, x is bound to the parameter value that is passed in, 2.
   :correct: c

   What will the following code output?

   .. code-block:: python

       def square(x):
           return x*x

       def g(y):
           return y + 3

       def h(y):
           return square(y) + 3

       print h(2)
