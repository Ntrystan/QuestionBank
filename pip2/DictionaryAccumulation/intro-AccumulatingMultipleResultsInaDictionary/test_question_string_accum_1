   :answer_a: print txt['e'] > txt['t']
   :answer_b: print x['e'] > x['t']
   :answer_c: print x[e] > x[t]
   :answer_d: print x[c] > txt[c]
   :answer_e: print e[x] > t[x]
   :feedback_a: txt is the variable that has the original text, not the dictionary of counts.
   :feedback_b: x is the dictionary of counts; you want to compare the values associated with 'e' and 't'.
   :feedback_c: x is the dictionary of counts, but you don't want to evaluate e and t as variables in order to determine which keys to look up in the dictionary.
   :feedback_d: It seems like maybe you're guessing. Please review the material above and then try again.
   :feedback_e: It seems like you've reversed things. The variable that refers to the dictionary goes outside the square brackets; the key you're looking up goes inside.
   :correct: b

   Which of the following will print out True if there are more occurrences of e than t in
   the text of A Study in Scarlet, and False if t occurred more frequently (assumming that the previous code, from dict_accum_5, has
   already run.)
