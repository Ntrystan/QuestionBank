   :answer_a: sorted(ks, key=g)
   :answer_b: sorted(ks, key=lambda x: g(x, d))
   :answer_c: sorted(ks, key=lambda x: d[x])
   :feedback_a: g is a function that takes two parameters. The key function passed to sorted must always take just one parameter
   :feedback_b: The lambda function takes just one parameter, and calls g with two parameters.
   :feedback_c: The lambda function looks up the value of x in d.
   :correct: b,c

   Which of the following will sort the keys of d in ascending order of their values (i.e., from lowest to highest)?

   .. code-block:: python

        L = [4, 5, 1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 4, 3]

        d = {}
        for x in L:
            if x in d:
                d[x] = d[x] + 1
            else:
                d[x] = 1

        def g(k, d):
            return d[k]

        ks = d.keys()
