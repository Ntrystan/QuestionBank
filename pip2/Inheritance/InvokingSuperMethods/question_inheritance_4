   :answer_c: ["chirp"]
   :answer_d: Error
   :feedback_a: This would print if the code was print b1.chirp_number.
   :feedback_b: We set b1 to be Bird('tweety', 5) above.  Bird is a subclass of Pet, which has ["Mrrp"] for sounds, but Bird has a different value for that class variable. The interpreter looks in the subclass first.
   :feedback_c: The interpeter finds the value in the class variable for the class Bird.
   :feedback_d: We ran set b1 to be Bird('tweety', 5) above.  Bird has a value set for the attribute sounds.
   :correct: c

   What will print when ``print b1.sounds`` is run?
