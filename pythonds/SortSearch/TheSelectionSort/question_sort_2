   :answer_a: [7, 11, 12, 1, 6, 14, 8, 18, 19, 20]
   :answer_b: [7, 11, 12, 14, 19, 1, 6, 18, 8, 20]
   :answer_c: [11, 7, 12, 14, 1, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20]
   :answer_d: [11, 7, 12, 14, 8, 1, 6, 18, 19, 20]
   :feedback_a: Selection sort is similar to bubble sort (which you appear to have done) but uses fewer swaps
   :feedback_b: This looks like an insertion sort.
   :feedback_c: This one looks similar to the correct answer but instead of swapping the numbers have been shifted to the left to make room for the correct numbers.
   :feedback_d: Selection sort improves upon bubble sort by making fewer swaps.

   Suppose you have the following list of numbers to sort:
   [11, 7, 12, 14, 19, 1, 6, 18, 8, 20] which list represents the partially sorted list after three complete passes of selection sort?
