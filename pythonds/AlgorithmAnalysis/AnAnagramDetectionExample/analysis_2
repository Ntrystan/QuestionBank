    :correct: a
    :feedback_b: Be careful, in counting loops you want to make sure the loops are nested.
    :feedback_d: Be careful, in counting loops you want to make sure the loops are nested.
    :feedback_c: log n typically is indicated when the problem is iteratvely made smaller
    :feedback_a: Even though there are two loops they are not nested.  You might think of this as O(2n) but we can ignore the constant 2.

    Given the following code fragment what is its Big-O running time?

    .. code-block:: python

      test = 0
      for i in range(n):
         test = test + 1

      for j in range(n):
         test = test - 1
