   Construct a block of code that correctly implements the recursive function for calcuating the factorial.
   -----
	def factorial(n):
		print("factorial has been called with n = " + str(n))
		if n == 1:
			return 1
		else:
			res = n * factorial(n-1)
			print("intermediate result for ", n, " * factorial(" ,n-1, "): ",res)
			return res	

	print(factorial(5))
