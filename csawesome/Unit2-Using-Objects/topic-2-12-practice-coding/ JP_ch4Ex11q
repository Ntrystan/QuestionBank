   The following code should insert the word that is stored in the String variable ``target`` (including the following space) into the phrase that is stored in the String variable ``message``.

   ``target`` should be inserted immediately following the word that matches the string value that is stored in ``insertionPoint``.

   1. Use ``indexOf`` to find the position (``pos``) of a substring in your string.  

   2. Use ``substring`` to create a new string that represents the first part of the word (``partFirst``).

   3. Use ``substring`` to create a new string that represents the last part of the word (``partLast``).

   4. Concatenate ``partFirst``, ``target`` , and ``partLast`` to produce the final ``result``.

   5. Print the result.
