   :answer_a: int rn = (int) (Math.random() * 25) + 36;
   :answer_b: int rn = (int) (Math.random() * 25) + 60;
   :answer_c: int rn = (int) (Math.random() * 26) + 60;
   :answer_d: int rn = (int) (Math.random() * 36) + 25;
   :answer_e: int rn = (int) (Math.random() * 60) + 25;
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Remember that (int)(Math.random()*range) + min moves the random number into a range starting from a minimum number. We want the minimum number to be 25, but the minimum number here would be 36.
   :feedback_b: Remember that (int)(Math.random()*range) + min moves the random number into a range starting from a minimum number. We want the minimum number to be 25, but the minimum number here would be 60.
   :feedback_c: Remember that (int)(Math.random()*range) + min moves the random number into a range starting from a minimum number. Here the min is 25. We want the minimum number to be 25, but the minimum number here would be 60.
   :feedback_d: Yes, (int)(Math.random()*36) + 25 moves the random number into a range of 36 numbers starting from a minimum number 25 up to 60. The range is (max number - min number + 1) which is (60-25 +1) = 36.
   :feedback_e: This would give us random numbers from 25 to 85. Remember that you can compute the range you need with (max number - min number + 1).

   Which of the following statements assigns a random integer between 25 and 60, inclusive, to rn?
