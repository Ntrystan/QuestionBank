    This program can't be written in the window below!!!!!

    Instead, you have to write your program in the window for 2.1.3 - Programming Challenge: Turtle Drawing

    Your assignment is to draw an interesting shape, something besides a square or triangle. 
    The shape doesn't have to be complicated, but the point is to be intentional about your design.

    See https://canvas.park.edu/courses/49710/assignments/1485674 for a complete description of the assignment.
