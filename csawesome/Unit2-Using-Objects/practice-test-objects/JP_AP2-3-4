    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Cat
        {
            public void meow()
            {
                System.out.print("Meow! Meow! ");
            }

            public void purr()
            {
                System.out.print("purrrrrrrr... ");
            }

            public void happy()
            {
                purr();
                meow();
            }
            /* Constructors not shown */
        }

    Which of the following code segments, if located in a method in a class other than Cat, will cause the message "purrrrrrrr... purrrrrrrr... Meow! Meow! " to be printed?

    - .. code-block:: java

        Cat a = new Cat();
        a.meow();
        a.purr();

      - This would print "Meow! Meow! purrrrrrrr... "

    - .. code-block:: java

        Cat a = new Cat();
        Cat.happy();

      - You must use the object a, not the class name Cat, to call its methods.

    - .. code-block:: java

        Cat a = new Cat();
        a.happy();

      - This would print out "purrrrrrrr... Meow! Meow! ".

    - .. code-block:: java

        Cat a = new Cat();
        a.purr();
        a.happy();

      + This would print out "purrrrrrrr... purrrrrrrr... Meow! Meow! ";

    - .. code-block:: java

         Cat a = new Cat();
         a.purr();

      - This would just print "purrrrrrrr... ".
