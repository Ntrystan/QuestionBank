   :answer_a: Liquid l = new Liquid(98.6);
   :answer_b: new Liquid l = 98.6;
   :answer_c: Liquid l = new Liquid();
   :answer_d: Liquid l = 98.6;
   :answer_e: Liquid l = Liquid(98.6);
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct
   :feedback_b: new is incorrectly placed.
   :feedback_c: This creates an object but it does not set its boiling point to 98.6.
   :feedback_d: The call to the constructor is missing.
   :feedback_e: The keyword new is missing.

    Consider the following class. Which of the following code segments, when placed in a method in a class other than Liquid, will construct a Liquid object l with a boilingPoint of 98.6 ?

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
            private double boilingPoint;
            private double freezingPoint;

            public Liquid()
            {
                boilingPoint = 0.0;
            }

            public Liquid(double b)
            {
                boilingPoint = b;
            }
        }
