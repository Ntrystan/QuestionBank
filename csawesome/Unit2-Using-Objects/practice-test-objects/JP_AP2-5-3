    Consider the following method in the TeamRank class.

    .. code-block:: java

        public double calculateTeamRank(int numOfGoalsFor, int numGoalsAgainst, double winPercentage)
        { /*implementation not shown */}

    Which of the following lines of code, if located in a method in the same class as calculateTeamRank, will compile without an error?

    - int rank = calculateTeamRank(234, 56, 0.450);

      - The method returns a double which cannot be saved in an int variable.

    - double rank = calculateTeamRank(100.0, 3.0, 0.560);

      - The first two parameters must be ints.

    - double rank = calculateTeamRank(455,215, false);

      - The method takes a double for winPercentage, not a boolean.

    - double rank = calculateTeamRank(310, 420, 0.450);

      + Correct.

    - double rank = calculateMovieRating(310,420);

      - The method has 3 parameters.
