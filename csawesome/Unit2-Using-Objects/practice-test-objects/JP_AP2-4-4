    Consider the following methods, which appear in the same class.

    .. code-block:: java

        public void calculatePizzaOrder(int numOfPeople, double slicesPerPerson)
        {
            int numOfPizzas = (numOfPeople * slicesPerPerson)/8;
            /* INSERT CODE HERE */
        }

        public void printOrder(int number)
        {
            System.out.println("Order " + number + " pizzas ");
        }

    What of the following lines would go into ``/* INSERT CODE HERE */`` in line 4 in order to call the ``printOrder`` method to print the number of pizzas to order correctly?

    - printOrder(numOfPizzas);

      + Correct! If you had 8 people who want to eat 2 pizza slices each, numOfPizzas would be 8*2/8 = 2 pizzas, and printOrder would print out "Order 2 pizzas".

    - printOrder(numOfPeople);

      - This would always print out an order of how many people you have instead of how many calculated pizzas.

    - printOrder(2);

      - This would always print out "Order 2 pizzas" instead of the calculated number of pizzas.

    - printOrder(slicesPerPerson);

      - This would always print out an order of how many slices per person instead of how many calculated pizzas.

    - calculatePizzaOrder(numOfPizzas);

      - This would not call the printOrder method.
