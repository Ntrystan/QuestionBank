   :feedback_b: The classname is Liquid and the object instance is liquid1.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: The classname is Liquid and the object instance is liquid1.
   :feedback_e: An attribute of liquid1 is freezingPoint.

    A student has created a Liquid class. The class contains variables to represent the following.
    - A double variable called boilingPoint to represent the boiling point of the liquid.
    - A double variable called freezingPoint to represent at what temperature the liquid will freeze.
    - A boolean variable called hasFrozen to indicate whether the liquid is now frozen.

    The object liquid1 will be declared as type Liquid.
