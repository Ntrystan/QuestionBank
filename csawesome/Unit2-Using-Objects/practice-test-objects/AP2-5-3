    .. code-block:: java

        public double calculateMovieRating(int numOfPeople, double rating)
        { /*implementation not shown */}

    Which of the following lines of code, if located in a method in the same class as calculateMovieRating, will compile without an error?

    - int result = calculateMovieRating(234, null);

      - The method returns a double which cannot be saved in an int variable.

    - double result = calculateMovieRating(100.0, 3.0);

      - The first parameter must be an int.

    - int result = calculateMovieRating(455, false);

      - The method returns a double which cannot be saved in an int variable.

    - double result = calculateMovieRating(10, 4.0);
