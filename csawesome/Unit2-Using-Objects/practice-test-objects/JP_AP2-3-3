   :answer_a: core.shutdown(250);
   :answer_b: core.shutdown();
   :answer_c: core.increaseTemp();
   :answer_d: coreshutdown();
   :answer_e: core.shutdown;
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Method shutdown() does not take any parameters.
   :feedback_b: Correct
   :feedback_c: There is no method increaseTemp() in the ReactorCore class definition.
   :feedback_d: The dot operator is required between the object name and the method name.
   :feedback_e: Parentheses are required after a method name.

    Consider the following class. Assume that the ReactorCore object core has been properly declared and initialized in a method in a class other than ReactorCore.  Which of the following statements are valid?

    .. code-block:: java

        public class ReactorCore
        {
          private double criticalTemp;
          private double shutdownTemp;
          private double currentTemp;

          public ReactorCore(double b)
          {
            criticalTemp = b;
          }

          void lowerTemp()
          {
            currentTemp -= 10;
          }

          void raiseTemp()
          {
            currentTemp += 10;
          }

          void shutdown()
          {
            currentTemp = shutdownTemp;
          }
        }
