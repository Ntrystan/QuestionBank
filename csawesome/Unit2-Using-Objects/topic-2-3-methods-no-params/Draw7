   The following code uses a turtle to draw the digital number 7, but the lines are mixed up.  Drag the code blocks to the right and put them in the correct order to first draw the line going up and then the line going across to the left to make a 7. Remember that the turtle is facing up at the start. Click on the "Check Me" button to check your solution.  You can copy and paste this code in the Active Code window below to see it in action.
