    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
            private double boilingPoint;
            private double freezingPoint;
            private double currentTemp;

            public Liquid()
            {
                currentTemp = 50;
            }

            public void lowerTemp()
            {
                currentTemp -= 10;
            }

            public double getTemp()
            {
                return currentTemp;
            }
        }

    Assume that the following code segment appears in a class other than Liquid.

    .. code-block:: java

        Liquid water = new Liquid();
        water.lowerTemp();
        System.out.println(water.getTemp());

    What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

    - \-10

      - The Liquid() constructor sets the currentTemp instance variable to 50 and the lowerTemp() method subtracts 10 from it.

    - 50

      - The Liquid() constructor sets the currentTemp instance variable to 50 and the lowerTemp() method subtracts 10 from it.

    - water.getTemp()

      - The System.out.println will print the value returned from water.getTemp().

    - The code will not compile.

      - This code should compile.

    - 40.0

      + Correct, the Liquid() constructor sets the currentTemp instance variable to 50 and the lowerTemp() method subtracts 10 from it, and getTemp() returns the currentTemp value as a double.
