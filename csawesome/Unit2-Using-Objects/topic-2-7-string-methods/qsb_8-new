   :feedback_a: H is after B in the alphabet so s1 is greater than s2.
   :feedback_b: The method compareTo will only return 0 if the strings have the same characters in the same order.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was s2.compareTo(s1)

   What is the value of answer after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = "Hi";
     String s2 = "Bye";
     int answer = s1.compareTo(s2);
