   :feedback_a: x needs to be initialized with a call to the SomeClass constructor.
   :feedback_b: x and someVar have not been initialized.
   :feedback_c: This will give an error that x has not been initialized. It needs to be initialized with a call to the SomeClass constructor.
   :feedback_d: This code will not run.

   Assume that SomeClass and MainClass are properly defined in separate files. What is the output of main()?

   .. code-block:: java

    class SomeClass
    {
        int someVar;
    }

    public class MainClass
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            SomeClass x;
            System.out.println(x.someVar);
        }
    }
