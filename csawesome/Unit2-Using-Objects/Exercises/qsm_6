   :feedback_a: The constructor is called first and prints out one "Hello ".
   :feedback_b: The constructor is called first and prints out one "Hello " followed by the printSomething() method which prints out "Hello Bob ".
   :feedback_c: The constructor is called first and prints out one "Hello ".
   :feedback_d: The constructor is called first and prints out one "Hello " followed by printSomething().

   Assume that SomeClass and MainClass are properly defined in separate files. What is the output of the code in main()?

   .. code-block:: java

      class SomeClass
      {
          public SomeClass()
          {
              System.out.print("Hello ");
          }

          void printSomething(String name)
          {
              System.out.print("Hello " + name + " ");
          }
      }

      public class MainClass
      {
          public static void main(String[] args)
          {
              SomeClass someClass = new SomeClass();
              someClass.printSomething("Bob");
          }
      }
