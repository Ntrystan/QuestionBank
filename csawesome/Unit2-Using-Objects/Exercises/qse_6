   :feedback_a: Remember that we have added and withdrawn money
   :feedback_b: The constructor sets the total to 100, the withdraw method subtracts 30, and then the deposit method adds 40.

   Given the BankAccount class definition below, what is the output of the code in the main method?

   .. code-block:: java

    public class BankAccount
    {
        private int accountID;
        private double total;

        public BankAccount(int id, double initialDeposit)
        {
            accountID = id;
            total = initialDeposit;
        }

        public void deposit(double money)
        {
            total = total + money;
        }

        public void withdraw(double money)
        {
            total = total - money;
        }

        public void printCurrentTotal()
        {
            System.out.print(total);
        }

        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            BankAccount newAccount = new BankAccount(12345, 100.00);
            newAccount.withdraw(30.00);
            newAccount.deposit(40.00);
            newAccount.printCurrentTotal();
        }
    }
