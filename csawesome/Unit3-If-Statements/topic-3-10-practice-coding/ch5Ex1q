   The following code should print ``x is greater than 0``.  However, the code has errors.  Fix the code so that it compiles and runs correctly.

   public class Test1
   {
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           int x = 3;
           if (x > 0
               System.out.println("x is greater than 0")
           else
               System.out.println(x is less than or equal 0");
       }
   }
