   :feedback_a: x is changed by the if statements.
   :feedback_b: What happens when x is greater than 2 and then greater than 4? Do both if statements.
   :feedback_c: If x is greater than 2, it's always doubled, and then that result is always greater than 4, so it's set to 0 in the second if statement.
   :feedback_d: x is changed by the if statements.
   :feedback_e: This code will compile.

   Consider the following code segment. What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

   .. code-block:: java

     int x = 3;
     if (x > 2)
     {
         x = x * 2;
     }
     if (x > 4)
     {
        x = 0;
     }
     System.out.print(x);
