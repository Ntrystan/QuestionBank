   :feedback_a: This code does not sort the items in the list and set replaces the value at that index.
   :feedback_b: This code does not sort the items in the list.
   :feedback_c: There is only one set. The add moves all current values at the index and above to the right one before adding at that index.
   :feedback_d: The add moves over all items at that index before adding the value at the index.
   :feedback_e: The add method with one parameters will add that value to end of the list.  The method set changes the value at that index in the list.  The method add with an index will move anything at the index or above one to the right and then set the value of that index.

   What will the following print?

   .. code-block:: java

      List<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
      list1.add(new Integer(5));
      list1.add(new Integer(4));
      list1.add(new Integer(3));
      list1.set(2, new Integer(2));
      list1.add(2, new Integer(1));
      list1.add(new Integer(0));
      System.out.println(list1);
