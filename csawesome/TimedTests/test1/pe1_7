   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This will loop i from 0 to 4 and from j from 0 to i.  So, it won't output any 5s.
   :feedback_b: This will loop with i changing from 1 to 4 and j from i to 0.
   :feedback_c: This will loop with i changing from 1 to 5 and then for each I, j will loop from i to 0 printing the value of i and then a new line.
   :feedback_d: This will loop with i changing from 1 to 5 and j from 0 to i but it will print each value on a different line.
   :feedback_e: This will loop with i changing from 0 to 4 and j from 0 to i

   Which of the following code will produce this output:

   .. code-block:: java

      1
      22
      333
      4444
      55555

      I.

      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            System.out.print(i);
         }
         System.out.println();
      }

      II.

      for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
         for (int j = i; j > 0; j--) {
            System.out.print(i);
         }
         System.out.println();
      }

      III.

      for (int i  = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
         for (int j = i; j > 0; j--) {
            System.out.print(i);
         }
         System.out.println();
      }

      IV.

      for (int i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            System.out.println(i);
         }
      }

      V.

      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            System.out.print(i+1);
         }
         System.out.println();
      }
