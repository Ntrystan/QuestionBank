   :answer_b: {1,3,8,5,6}, {1,3,8,5,6}, {1,3,5,8,6}, {1,3,5,6,8}

   :answer_d: {1,3,8,5,6}, {1,3,5,8,6}, {1,3,5,6,8}
   :answer_e: {1,6,3,8,5}, {1,3,6,8,5}, {1,3,5,6,8}
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This is almost right, but there should be 4 of these steps.
   :feedback_b: This is selection sort, not insertion.   Selection will find the smallest and swap it with the first element in the array.
   :feedback_c: An insertion sort will skip the first position and then loop inserting the next item into the correct place in the sorted elements to the left of the current item.
   :feedback_d: This is selection sort, not insertion and it is also an incorrect selection sort since it skips one step.
   :feedback_e: This doesn't match selection, insertion, or merge sort.

   Which of the following correctly shows the iterations of an ascending (from left to right) insertion sort on an array with the following elements: {6,3,8,5,1}?
