   :feedback_a: A substring of (0,3) will have 3 characters in it (index 0, index 1, and index 2).
   :feedback_b: Remember that substring with two numbers starts at the first index and ends before the second.  So s1 = Computer, s2 = mputer, s3 = mpu
   :feedback_c: A substring of (0,3) will have 3 characters in it (index 0, index 1, and index 2).
   :feedback_d: Remember that the first character in a string object is at index 0.
   :feedback_e: A substring of (0,3) will have 3 characters in it (index 0, index 1, and index 2).

   What is the output from the following code?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s = "Computer Science is fun!";
     String s1 = s.substring(0,8);
     String s2 = s1.substring(2);
     String s3 = s2.substring(0,3);
     System.out.println(s3);
