   :answer_b: [c, e, d, b, g]
   :answer_c: [a, c, e, g]
   :answer_d: [a, b, e, d, g]
   :answer_e: [a, c, e, d, b, g]
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was list.add(2, "e") instead of list.set(2, "e").
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the first item in a list was at index 1, but it is at index 0.
   :feedback_c: This code adds "a" to the end of the list: ["a"] and then "b" to the end of the list: ["a", "b"].  Then it changes the value at index 1 to "c": ["a", "c"]. Then it adds "d" at position 2 which first moves to the right any existing values ["a", "c", "d"].   Then it sets the value at index 2 to "e": ["a", "c", "e"].  Then it adds "g" to the end: ["a", "c", "e", "g"].
   :feedback_d: For this to be true the 3rd line would have to be list.add("c").  Is it?
   :feedback_e: This would be true if all of the sets were adds.

   What is printed when the following code executes (runs)?

   .. code-block:: java

      List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
      list.add("a");
      list.add("b");
      list.set(1,"c");
      list.add(2, "d");
      list.set(2, "e");
      list.add("g");
      System.out.println(list);
