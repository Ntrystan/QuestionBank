   :answer_a: I only
   :answer_b: II only
   :answer_c: III only
   :answer_d: I and III only
   :answer_e: I, II, and III
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: I does work, but so does another one.
   :feedback_b: The compiler will look for the method based on the declared type.  The declared type for b is Animal and Animal doesn't have a growl method.
   :feedback_c: III does work, but so does another one.
   :feedback_d: I works since the declared type is Animal and Animal has an eat method.  III works because the cast tells the compiler to treat b is a Bear and Bear has a growl method.
   :feedback_e: Does Animal have a growl method? Remember that the compiler checks for the method using the declared type.

   Assume that list has been initialized with the following Integer objects: [9, 3, 17, 2, 16, 4, 1].  Which of the following shows the values in list after a call of mystery(4)?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Animal {
         // constructors not shown
         public void eat()
         { // code not shown
         }
      }

      public class Bear extends Animal {
         // constructors not shown
         public void growl()
         { // code not shown
         }
      }

      Assume that the following declaration is in a different class.
      Animal b = new Bear();

      Which of the following will compile without error?
      I.    b.eat();
      II.   b.growl;
      III.  ((Bear) b).growl();
