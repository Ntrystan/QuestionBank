   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This would be true if line 3 was: System.out.print(j + " " + k + " ");
   :feedback_b: This would be true if line 1 was: for (int j = 1; j < 5; j++).
   :feedback_c: This would be true if line 1 was: for (int j = 1; j < 5; j++) and if line 3 was: System.out.print(j + " " + k + " ");
   :feedback_d: This would be true if line 1 was: for (int j = 5; j >=1; j--) and line 2 was: for (int k = 1; k <= 3; k++).
   :feedback_e: This prints j * k and for each value of j from 1 to 5, k changes from 1 to 2.  So when j is 1 it will print 1 2.  When j is 2 it will print 2 4.  When j is 3 it will print 3 6.  When j is 4 it will print 4 8.  When j is 5 it will print 5 10.

   What is the output from the following code segment?

   .. code-block:: java

      for (int j = 1; j <=5; j++) {
         for (int k = 1; k < 3; k++)
            System.out.print(j * k + " ");
      }
