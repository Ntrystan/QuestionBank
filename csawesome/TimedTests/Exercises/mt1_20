   :feedback_a: This would be true if num1 and num2 were both greater than 0 and num1 was greater than num2.  However, num2 is less than 0.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if num1 and num2 were both greater than 0 and num1 was less than or equal to num2.  However, num2 is less than 0.
   :feedback_c: The first test is false since num2 is less than 0 and for a complex conditional joined with And (&&) to be true both expressions must be true.  Next, else if ((num2<0) || (num1<0)) is executed and this will be true since num2 is less than 0 and for a complex conditional joined with Or (||) only one of the expressions must be true for it to execute.
   :feedback_d: This will not happen since if num2 is less than 0 the previous conditional would be true ((num2<0) || (num1<0))).
   :feedback_e: This will not happen since if num2 is less than 0 the previous conditional would be true ((num2<0) || (num1<0))).

   Consider the following method.  What is the output from ``conditionTest(3,-2);``?

   .. code-block:: java

      public static void conditionTest(int num1, int num2)
      {
         if ((num1 > 0) && (num2 > 0)) {
            if (num1 > num2)
               System.out.println("A");
            else
               System.out.println("B");
         }
         else if ((num2 < 0) || (num1 < 0)) {
             System.out.println("C");
         }
         else if (num2 < 0) {
            System.out.println("D");
         }
         else {
            System.out.println("E");
         }
     }
