   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This implementation of ''addMinutes'' does not account for values of additionMinutes that push the minute count above 60.
   :feedback_b: Implementation II works, but implementation III also works.
   :feedback_c: Implementation IV does not work for situations where additionMinutes + minutes does not go above 60.
   :feedback_d: Correct!
   :feedback_e: Implementations II and III are correct, but implementation I is not. Implementation I does not account for values of additionMinutes that push the minute account above 60.

   Consider the following declaration for a class that will be used to represent points in time.  Which of these options correctly implement ''addMinutes()''?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Timer
      {
         private int hours; // number of hours
         private int minutes; // 0 <= minutes < 60

         void addHours(int addition)
         {
            hours = hours + addition;
         }

                           void addMinutes(int additionMinutes)
                           {
                              // implementation not shown
                           }

         // ... other methods not shown

      }

     Proposed Implementations:

     I.   public void addMinutes(int additionMinutes)
          {
             minutes = minutes + additionMinutes;
          }

     II.  public void addMinutes(int additionMinutes)
          {
             if(minutes + additionMinutes >= 60)
             {
                hours += (additionMinutes/60);
                minutes += (additionMinutes % 60);
             }
             else
             {
                     minutes += minutes + additionMinutes;
             }
          }

     III. public void addMinutes(int additionMinutes)
          {
               minutes += additionMinutes;
               while(minutes >= 60)
               {
                                   hours++;
                                   minutes -= 60;
                               }
          }

     IV.  public void addMinutes(int additionMinutes){
          {
                    if(additionMinutes + minutes >= 60)
                    {
                        minutes = additionMinutes + minutes - 60;
                        hours += 1;
                    }
          }
