   :answer_d: This code will not print anything.
   :answer_e: 0 3 6 9 12
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be true if this loop had the correct syntax on the print.
   :feedback_b: The conditional would only match multiples of three, and the program does not output anything due to incorrect syntax.
   :feedback_c: The conditional would only match multiples of three, and the program does not output anything due to incorrect syntax.
   :feedback_d: The syntax to output text is System.out.print(), so this code will cause a compiler error.
   :feedback_e: The program would also output 15, since the loop runs until x <= 15. However, the program does not output anything due to incorrect syntax.

   What will be printed after this code is executed?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int i = 0; i <= 15; i++) {
        if (i % 3 == 0) {
            System.print(i + " ");
        }
     }
