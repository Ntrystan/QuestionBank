   :answer_a: Yes
   :answer_b: No
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Look at what <code>getName</code> is supposed to return.
   :feedback_b: This solution doesn't include the "/" between the sandwich and salad and between the salad and the drink and is also missing the "Trio" at the end of the name, so it loses this point.

   Should the student earn 1 point for correctly constructing the string to return from ``getName`` and making it available to be returned?
