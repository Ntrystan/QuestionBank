   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Remember that all instance variables should be declared private so that the class controls access to the variables.
   :feedback_b: The student did not make the instance variables private, so the student does not get this point.

   Should the student earn 1 point for declaring the private instance variables (sandwich, salad, and drink or name and price)?
