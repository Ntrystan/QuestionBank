   :answer_d: ABC
   :answer_e: Nothing is printed.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the object was created of type Base using new Base. But the object is really a Derived object. So all methods are looked for starting with the Derived class.
   :feedback_b: Even though b is declared as type Base it is created as an object of the Derived class, so all methods to it will be resolved starting with the Derived class. So the methodOne() in Derived will be called. This method first calls super.methodOne so this will invoke the method in the superclass (which is Base). So next the methodOne in Base will execute. This prints the letter "A" and invokes this.methodTwo(). Since b is really a Derived object, we check there first to see if it has a methodTwo. It does, so execution continues in Derived's methodTwo. This method invokes super.methodTwo. So this will invoke the method in the super class (Base) named methodTwo. This method prints the letter "B" and then returns. Next the execution returns from the call to the super.methodTwo and prints the letter "D". We return to the Base class methodOne and return from that to the Derived class methodOne and print the letter "C".
   :feedback_c: After the call to methodOne in the super class printing "A", the code continues with the implicit this.methodTwo which resolves from the current object's class which is Derived. methodTwo in the Derived class is executed which then calls super.methodTwo which invokes printin "B" from methodTwo in the Base class. Then the "D" in the Derive methodTwo is printed. Finally the program returns to methodOne in the Derived class are prints "C".
   :feedback_d: The call to methodTwo in super.methodOne is to this.methodTwo which is the method from the Derived class. Consequently the "D" is also printed.
   :feedback_e: Remember that it will first look for a method in its own class.

   Given the following class declarations, and assuming that the following declaration appears in a client program: ``Base b = new Derived();``, what is the result of the call ``b.methodOne();``?

   .. code-block:: java

     public class Base
     {
        public void methodOne()
        {
          System.out.print("A");
          methodTwo();
        }

        public void methodTwo()
        {
          System.out.print("B");
        }
     }

     public class Derived extends Base
     {
        public void methodOne()
        {
           super.methodOne();
           System.out.print("C");
        }

        public void methodTwo()
        {
          super.methodTwo();
          System.out.print("D");
        }
     }
