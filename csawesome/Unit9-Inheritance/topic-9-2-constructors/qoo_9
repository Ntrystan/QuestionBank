   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: I is okay but III is also okay.
   :feedback_b: NamedPoint will inherit from MPoint all fields but the fields are private and they can not be directly accessed in NamedPoint. You can use super as the first line in a constructor to initialize inherited fields. You can also set your own fields in a constructor. If you don't use super as the first line in a constructor one will be put there by the compiler that will call the parent's no argument constructor.
   :feedback_c: II is invalid. Children inherit all of the fields from a parent but do not have direct access to private fields. You can use super in a constructor to initialize inherited fields by calling the parent's constructor with the same parameter list.
   :feedback_d: I is also okay

   Given the class definitions of MPoint and NamedPoint below, which of the constructors that follow (labeled I, II, and III) would be valid in the NamedPoint class?

   .. code-block:: java


      class MPoint
      {
         private int myX; // coordinates
         private int myY;

         public MPoint( )
         {
            myX = 0;
            myY = 0;
         }

         public MPoint(int a, int b)
         {
            myX = a;
            myY = b;
         }

         // ... other methods not shown

      }

      public class NamedPoint extends MPoint
      {
         private String myName;
         // constructors go here
         // ... other methods not shown
      }

      //  Proposed constructors for this class:
      I.   public NamedPoint()
           {
              myName = "";
           }
      II.  public NamedPoint(int d1, int d2, String name)
           {
              myX = d1;
              myY = d2;
              myName = name;
           }
      III. public NamedPoint(int d1, int d2, String name)
           {
              super(d1, d2);
              myName = name;
           }
