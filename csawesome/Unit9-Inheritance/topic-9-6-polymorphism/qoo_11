   :answer_a: Pizza
   :answer_b: Taco
   :answer_c: You will get a compile time error
   :answer_d: You will get a run-time error
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if s1 was actually a Student, but it is a GradStudent.  Remember that the run-time will look for the method first in the class that created the object.
   :feedback_b: Even though the getInfo method is in Student when getFood is called the run-time will look for that method first in the class that created this object which in this case is the GradStudent class.
   :feedback_c: This code will compile.  The student class does have a getInfo method.
   :feedback_d: There is no problem at run-time.

   What is the output from running the main method in the Student class?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Student {

         public String getFood() {
            return "Pizza";
         }

         public String getInfo()  {
           return this.getFood();
         }

         public static void main(String[] args)
         {
           Student s1 = new GradStudent();
           s1.getInfo();
         }
      }

      class GradStudent extends Student {

        public String getFood() {
           return "Taco";
        }

      }
