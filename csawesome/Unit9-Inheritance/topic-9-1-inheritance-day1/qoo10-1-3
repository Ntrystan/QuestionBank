   :feedback_a: Is a parking garage a kind of vehicle?
   :feedback_b: No, a parking garage is not a kind of vehicle.  Instead it has vehicles in it which implies that the ParkingGarage class would have a field that tracks the vehicles in it.

   If I had a class ParkingGarage should it inherit from the class Vehicle?
