   :answer_a: Yes
   :answer_b: No
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This solution doesn't include the "Trio" at the end of the name so it loses this point.
   :feedback_b: While the name is mostly correct, it is missing the word "Trio" at the end which means it loses this point.

   Should the student earn 1 point for correctly constructing the string to return from ``getName`` and making it available to be returned?
