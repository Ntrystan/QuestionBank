   :feedback_a: This would be true if the row index started at 0, but the column index started at 1.
   :feedback_b: Both the row and column indicies start with 0.
   :feedback_c: The value 6 is at row 0 and column 2.
   :feedback_d: The row index is specified first, then the column index.
   :feedback_e: The row index is specified first and the indicies start at 0.

   How would you get the value 6 out of the following array ``int[][] a = { {2, 4, 6, 8}, {1, 2, 3, 4}};``?
