    Consider the following class definition that defines a Liquid class with a boilingPoint, a currentTemperature, and a freezingPoint. For example, Liquid water = new Liquid(100, 50, 0); defines a water object with a boiling point of 100, a current temperature of 50, and a freezing temperature of 0.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
            private int boilingPoint;
            private int currentTemp;
            private int freezingPoint;

            public Liquid(int bp, int ct, int fp)
            {
                boilingPoint = bp;
                currentTemp = ct;
                freezingPoint = fp;
            }
            /* Other methods not shown */
        }

    Which of the following preconditions is reasonable for the Liquid constructor?

    - Precondition: fp \> 0

      - Incorrect. The freezing point could be negative.

    - Precondition: currentTemp \> 0

      - Incorrect. Unable to make this assumption for all liquids.

    - Precondition: fp < ct < bp

      + Correct!

    - Precondition: fp > ct > bp

      - Incorrect. This would again result in freezing point being > boiling point which is impossible.
