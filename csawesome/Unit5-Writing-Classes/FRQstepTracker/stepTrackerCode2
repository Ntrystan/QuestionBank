   public class StepTracker
   {
      // copy the instance variable declarations here


      // copy the constructor with a parameter here

      // Write the accessor method activeDays() here
      // @return activeDays

      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
         StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(10000);
         System.out.println(tr.activeDays()); // returns 0. No data have been recorded yet.
      }
   }
