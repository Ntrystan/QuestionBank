   Copy the code from your draft of the class StepTracker above  with the class name, the instance variables, constructor, and accessory method. Write the mutator method **addDailySteps** which takes a parameter and adds it to the appropriate instance variable and changes other instance variables appropriately.

   public class StepTracker
   {
      // copy the instance variable declarations here


      // copy the constructor with a parameter here

      // copy the accessor method activeDays() here.

      // Write the mutator method addDailySteps here.
      // @param number of steps taken that day



      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
         StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(10000);
         System.out.println(tr.activeDays()); // returns 0. No data have been recorded yet.
         tr.addDailySteps(9000); // This is too few steps for the day to be considered active.
         tr.addDailySteps(5000); // This is too few steps for the day to be considered active.
         System.out.println(tr.activeDays()); // returns 0.  No day had at least 10,000 steps.
         tr.addDailySteps(13000); // This represents an active day.
         System.out.println(tr.activeDays());  // returns 1. Of the three days for which step data were entered, one day had at least 10,000 steps.
      }
   }
