    Consider the following class definitions.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
            private int currentTemp;

            public Liquid (int ct)
            {
                currentTemp = ct;
            }

            public int getCurrentTemp()
            {
                return currentTemp;
            }

            public void addToJar(LiquidJar j)
            {
                j.addLiquid(this);
            }
        }

        public class LiquidJar
        {
            private int totalTemp;

            public LiquidJar()
            {
              totalTemp = 0;
            }

            public void addLiquid(Liquid l)
            {
                totalTemp += l.getCurrentTemp();
            }

            public int getTotalTemp()
            {
                return totalTemp;
            }
            // Constructor not shown.
        }

    Consider the following code segment, which appears in a class other than Liquid or LiquidJar.

    .. code-block:: java

            Liquid water = new Liquid(50);
            Liquid milk = new Liquid(15);

            LiquidJar j = new LiquidJar();
            water.addToJar(j);
            milk.addToJar(j);
            System.out.println(j.getTotalTemp());

    What, if anything, is printed out after the execution of the code segment?

    - 50

      - The liquid water has a temperature of 50 but more is added to the jar.

    - 15

      - The liquid milk has a temperature of 15 but more is added to the jar.

    - 65

      + Correct! The liquid water with a temperature of 50 and then the liquid milk with a temperature of 15 are added to the jar.

    - Nothing, the code segment attempts to access the private variable currentTemp outside of its scope.

      - Incorrect. The currentTemp is never used outside its scope.

    - Nothing, the code segment attempts to access the private variable totalTemp outside of its scope.

      - Incorrect. The totalTemp is never used outside its scope.
