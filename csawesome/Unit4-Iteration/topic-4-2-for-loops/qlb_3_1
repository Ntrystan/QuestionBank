   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This loop starts with i equal to 3 but ends when i is equal to 8.
   :feedback_b: What is i set to in the initialization area?
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the for loop was missing the change part <code>(int i = 3; i < 8; )</code> but it does increment i in the change part <code>(int i = 3; i < 8; i++)</code>.
   :feedback_d: The value of i is set to 3 before the loop executes and the loop stops when i is equal to 8.  So the last time through the loop i is equal to 7.

   What does the following code print?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int i = 3; i < 8; i++)
     {
        System.out.print(i + " ");
     }
