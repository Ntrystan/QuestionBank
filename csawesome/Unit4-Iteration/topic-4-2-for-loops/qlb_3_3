   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if i started at 0 and ended at 9.  Does it?
   :feedback_b: Since i starts at 3 and the last time through the loop it is 9 the loop executes 7 times (9 - 3 + 1 = 7)
   :feedback_c: How many numbers are between 3 and 9 (including 3 and 9)?
   :feedback_d: This would be true if i started at 0 and the value of i the last time through the loop it was 8.

   How many times does the following method print a ``*``?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int i = 3; i <= 9; i++)
     {
        System.out.print("*");
     }
