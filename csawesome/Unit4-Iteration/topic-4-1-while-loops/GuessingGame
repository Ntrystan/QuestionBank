     // If the guess is less than the random number, print out "Too low!"
 
     // If the guess is greater than the random number, print out "Too high!"
  
     // Ask the user to guess a number from 1 to 100 
  
     // Get a new guess (save it into the same variable)
 
 

  // Print out something like "You got it!" OUTSIDE the loop
