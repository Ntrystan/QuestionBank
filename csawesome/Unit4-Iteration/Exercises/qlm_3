   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if we were printing out all of the values of k, not just the ones that have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.
   :feedback_b: This is missing the value 10 (10 divided by 3 does have a remainder of 1).
   :feedback_c: None of these answers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.
   :feedback_d: This answer would be correct if k was incremented by 1 instead of 2. K will be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 in this loop.
   :feedback_e: This will loop with k having a value of 0 to 18 (it will stop when k = 20). It will print out the value of k followed by a space when the remainder of dividing k by 3 is 1.

   What is printed as a result of the following code segment?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int k = 0; k < 20; k+=2) {
        if (k % 3 == 1)
           System.out.print(k + " ");
     }
