   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if i started at 0.
   :feedback_b: Note that it stops when i is 9.
   :feedback_c: Since i starts at 3 and the last time through the loop it is 8 the loop executes 8 - 3 + 1 times = 6 times.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if i started at 0 and ended when i was 10.  Does it?

   How many times does the following method print a ``*``?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int i = 3; i < 9; i++)
     {
        System.out.print("*");
     }
