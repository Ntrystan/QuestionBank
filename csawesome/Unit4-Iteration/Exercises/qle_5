   :feedback_a: The loop starts with i = 1 and loops as long as it is less than 5 so i is 1, 2, 3, 4.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the condition was i <= 5.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if i started at 0 and ended when it reached 6 (i <= 5).

   How many times does the following method print a ``*``?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++)
     {
        System.out.print("*");
     }
