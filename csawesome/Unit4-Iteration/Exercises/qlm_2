   :feedback_a: This will loop with i changing from 1 to 5 and then for each i, j will loop from i to 0 printing the value of i and then a new line.
   :feedback_b: This will loop i from 0 to 4 and j from 0 to i, neglecting to ouput 5.
   :feedback_c: This will loop with i changing from 1 to 4 and j from i to 0.
   :feedback_d: This will loop with i changing from 1 to 5 and j from 0 to i but it will print each value on a different line.
   :feedback_e: This will loop with i changing from 0 to 4 and j from 0 to i.
