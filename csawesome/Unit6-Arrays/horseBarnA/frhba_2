   :feedback_a: This String method is used for comparing two strings alphabetically. It returns 0 if they are equal so you would need to check the return value.
   :feedback_b: This would only return true if the two variables refer to the same object.
   :feedback_c: This String method will compare the characters in both strings and return true if they are the same.

   What is the best way to compare two strings for equality?
