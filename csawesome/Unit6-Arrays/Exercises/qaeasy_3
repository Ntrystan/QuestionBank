   :feedback_a: This would be returned from <code>arr[2]</code>.
   :feedback_b: This returns the value in <code>arr</code> at index 3.  Remember that the first item in an array is at index 0.
   :feedback_c: This would be returned from <code>arr[1]</code>.
   :feedback_d: This would be returned from <code>arr[0]</code>.
   :feedback_e: This would be returned from <code>arr.length</code>
