   The following code has an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. It has 2 common off-by-one errors in the loop. Can you fix it and make the loop print out all the scores?
   ~~~~
   public class OffByone
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
          int[] scores = { 10, 9, 8, 7};
          // Make this loop print out all the scores!
          for (int i = 1; i <= scores.length; i++)
          {
               System.out.println(  scores[i] );
          }
      }
    }
