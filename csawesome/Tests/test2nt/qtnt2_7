   :answer_a: I only

   :answer_c: III only
   :answer_d: I and II only
   :answer_e: I, II, and III
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Notice the incrementing in the for loop. The value i increments by 1, not by 2, so "012345678" is printed.
   :feedback_b: Notice the order of the incrementing and the print statement in the while loop. The value i increments before it is printed. The code never prints out 0, so "2468" is printed.
   :feedback_c: The value i starts at 0 and increments by 2, correctly printing out every value.
   :feedback_d: Notice the incrementing in the loops for I and II. In I, the value i increments by 1 and prints out too many values. In II, the first value is not printed.
   :feedback_e: III is correct, but I prints out every value between 0 and 8 and II does not print the first value.

   Which of these loops will output ``02468``?

   .. code-block:: java

      I. for (int i = 0; i <= 8; i++)
         {
            System.out.print(i);
         }

      II. int i = 0;
          while (i < 8)
          {
             i +=2;
             System.out.print(i);
          }

      III. for (int i = 0; i <= 8; i +=2)
           {
              System.out.print(i);
           }
