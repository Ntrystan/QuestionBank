   :feedback_a: Remember that in ArrayLists, indexing starts at 0, not at 1. If the add method has two parameters, then the value is added at a specific index, not at the end of the list.
   :feedback_b: The set method replaces a value at the specific index. The original value is erased.
   :feedback_c: Remember that there are two add methods for ArrayLists. If the add method has two parameters, then a value is added at a specific index, not at the end of the list.
   :feedback_d: Remember that in ArrayLists, indexing starts at 0, not at 1.
   :feedback_e: 4 is added to the end of the ArrayList, then 8 is added at index one between 7 and 3. The 3 in index two is removed, then the 2 in the second index is replaced with 1. Finally, 3 is added to the end of the ArrayList, which contains [7, 8, 1, 4, 3].

   Consider the following code. Assume that ``list`` is an ArrayList of integers that contains ``[7, 3, 2]``. What will the contents of ``list`` be after the following code is executed?

   .. code-block:: java

      list.add(4);
      list.add(1, 8);
      list.remove(2);
      list.set(2, 1);
      list.add(3);
