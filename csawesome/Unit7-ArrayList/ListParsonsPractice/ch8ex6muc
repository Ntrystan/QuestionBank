   The following method should calculate the average from an ArrayList of Integers (the parameter).  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed code from the left to the right and put them in order with the correct indention so that the code would work correctly.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>

   public static double average(ArrayList<Integer> nums) {
   =====
      double sum = 0;
   =====
      for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
   =====
      for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { #distractor
   =====
          sum += nums.get(i);
   =====
      } //end for loop
   =====
      return (sum / nums.size());
   =====
   } //end average method
