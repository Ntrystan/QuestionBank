   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: You can add duplicate objects to a list so this list will have two 1's.
   :feedback_b: The add method adds each object to the end of the list and lists can hold duplicate objects.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the list was sorted as you add to it, but this is not true.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the list was sorted and you couldn't add duplicate objects, but lists are not sorted and you can add duplicate objects.

   What will print when the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

      List<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
      list1.add(1);
      list1.add(3);
      list1.add(2);
      list1.add(1);
      System.out.println(list1);
