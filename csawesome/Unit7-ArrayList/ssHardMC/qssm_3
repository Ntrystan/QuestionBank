   :feedback_a: This would be true if there were three strings in the array that had the same first letter as the last letter.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if there were four strings in the array that had the same first letter as the last letter.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if there had been four strings in the array that had the first letter as an A and those strings' last letter was not an A.
   :feedback_d: This is the correct answer. The for loop is iterating through every element in the guestList array and the first if statement is checking to see if the current element in the array starts with the same letter and ends with the same letter. The variable, count decreases by one if that is true. However if that is false, the program goes to the else if statment and checks to see if the first letter is an A. If that is true count increases by one.

   What is printed when the following main method is executed?

   .. code-block:: java

          public class GuestList
          {
              public static void main(String[] args)
              {
                  int count = 0;
                  String[] guestList = {"Anna", "Briana", "Alex", "John"};
                  String subj1 = null;
                  String subj2 = null;
                  for (int j = 0; j < guestList.length; j++)
                  {
                      subj1 = guestList[j].substring(0,1);
                      subj2 = guestList[j].substring(guestList[j].length()-1);
                      if(subj1.equalsIgnoreCase(subj2))
                      {
                          count--;
                      }
                      else if(subj1.equalsIgnoreCase("a"))
                      {
                          count++;
                      }
                  }
                  System.out.println(count);
              }
          }
