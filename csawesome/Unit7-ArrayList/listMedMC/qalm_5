   :answer_b: [1, 4, 5]
   :answer_c: [1, 4, 3, 5]
   :answer_d: [2, 4, 5]

   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the code just added each integer at the end of the list.  But, that is not what it does.
   :feedback_b: The list is [1], then [1, 2], then [1], then [1, 3], then [1, 4], then [1, 4, 5].
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the <code>set</code> was an add.
   :feedback_d: This would be true it it was <code>remove(0)</code>.  Remember that it removes the object at the given index.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if the <code>set</code> was an add and if it was <code>remove(0)</code>.

   What is printed as a result of executing the following code segment?

   .. code-block:: java

     List<Integer> aList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
     aList.add(new Integer(1));
     aList.add(new Integer(2));
     aList.remove(1);
     aList.add(1, new Integer(3));
     aList.set(1, new Integer(4));
     aList.add(new Integer(5));
     System.out.println(list);
