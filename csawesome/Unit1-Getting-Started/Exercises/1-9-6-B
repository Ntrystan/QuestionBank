   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: (int) (Math.random() * 10) will return a number between 0 to 9, and then add 1 to those.
   :feedback_b: (int) (Math.random() * 10) will return a number between 0 to 9, and then add 1 to those to get a range from 1 to 10.
   :feedback_c: (int) (Math.random() * 10) will return a number between 0 to 9, and then add 1 to those.
   :feedback_d: (int) (Math.random() * 10) will return a number between 0 to 9, and then add 1 to those.
