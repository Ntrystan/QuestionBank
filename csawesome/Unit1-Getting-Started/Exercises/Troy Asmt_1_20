   Write a program that will calculate the unit cost of coffee.  
   (Coffee.  Java. Get it?!)  
   Assume the price of 12 ounces of coffee is $6.99.  
   There are 16 ounces in one pound. 
   Calculate the unit price of 1 pound of coffee.  
   Display your result in a sentence such as:

   "If 10 ounces of coffee is priced at $5.95, then the 
   unit price is $9.52 per pound of coffee."
