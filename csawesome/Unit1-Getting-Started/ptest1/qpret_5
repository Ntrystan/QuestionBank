    :feedback_a: No matter what x is set to originally, the code will reset it to 0.
    :feedback_b: Even if x is < 0, the above code will set it to 0.
    :feedback_c: Even if x is > than 0 originally, it will be set to 0 after the code executes.
    :feedback_d: The first if statment will always cause the second to be executed unless x already equals 0, such that x will never equal -x
    :feedback_e: The first if statement will always cause the second to be executed unless x already equals 0, such that x will never equal -x

    Given the following code segment, which of the following is this equivalent to?

    .. code-block:: java

        if ( x > 0) x = -x;
        if (x < 0) x = 0;
