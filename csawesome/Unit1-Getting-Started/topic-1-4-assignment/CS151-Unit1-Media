   Write a program to calculate the amount of money it will take to purchase some songs and audio books.
   You specify the number of songs and audio books, and then calculate the total cost based on
   $1.99 per song and $9.99 per audio book.

   public class Media
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
         // Fill in values for these variables - you choose
         int numSongs =
         int numBooks =

         // Write a formula to calculate the total cost


         // Print out the number of songs, audio books, and total cost 
         // Make sure you print out text too so that the user knows what is being printed out.
