   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Remember that 1234 % 10 returns the rightmost digit.
   :feedback_b: There are two calls that print something in this method.
   :feedback_c: There are two calls that print something in this method.
   :feedback_d: This method prints the right most digit and then removes the rightmost digit for the recursive call.  It prints both before and after the recursive call.
   :feedback_e: Since 1234 % 10 returns the rightmost digit, the first thing printed is 4.

        Given the method defined below what does the following print: mystery(1234)?

    .. code-block:: java
     :linenos:

     public static void mystery (int x) {
        System.out.print(x % 10);

        if ((x / 10) != 0) {
           mystery(x / 10);
        }
        System.out.print(x % 10);
     }
