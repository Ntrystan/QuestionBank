    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: No. Look carefully at the loop variable i.  Notice that the value of i is cut in half each time through the loop.  This is a big hint that the performance is better than O(n)
    :feedback_b: No. Check again, is this a nested loop?
    :feedback_c: Right! The value of i is cut in half each time through the loop so it will only take log n iterations.
    :feedback_d: No. Check again, is this a nested loop?

    Given the following code fragment what is its Big-O running time?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      int main(){
          int i = n;
          int count = 0;
          while (i > 0){
              count = count + 1;
              i = i // 2;
          }
          return 0;
      }
