    :feedback_a: The efficiency of erase in hash tables is constant.
    :feedback_b: The efficiency of insert in hash tables is constant.
    :feedback_c: Correct!
    :feedback_d: The efficiency of contains in hash tables is constant.
    :feedback_e: The efficiency of find in hash tables is constant.

    What is an operator for hash tables with an efficiency other than O(1)?
