    :answer_a: O(2n)
    :answer_b: O(n)
    :answer_c: O(3n<sup>2</sup>)
    :answer_d: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
    :answer_e: More than one of the above
    :correct: d
    :feedback_a: No, 3n<sup>2</sup> dominates 2n. Try again.
    :feedback_b: No, n<sup>2</sup> dominates n. Try again.
    :feedback_c: No, the 3 should be omitted because n<sup>2</sup> dominates.
    :feedback_d: Right!
    :feedback_e: No, only one of them is correct. Try again.


    If the exact number of steps is :math:`T(n)=2n+3n^{2}-1` what is the Big O?
