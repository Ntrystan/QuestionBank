    The Big O of a particular algorithm is :math:`O(log_{2}n)`. Given that it takes 2 seconds to complete the algorithm with 3 million inputs;
    how long would it take with 4 million inputs? You may use a calculator on this one.
    ``|blank|`` seconds.

    10 million?
    ``|blank|`` seconds.

    -   :.74: Correct!
        :.2 .53: Try higher.
        :2.26 3: Try lower.
        :.*: Incorrect. try again.
    -   :3.44: Correct!
        :.43 3: Incorrect. Try higher. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
        :6.45 3: Incorrect. Try lower. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
