    :answer_a: It only holds a series of vertices to traverse.
    :answer_b: It holds an unsorted list of unvisited vertices.
    :answer_c: It notes what vertices have been visited.
    :answer_d: It holds an appropriately sorted list of vertices to traverse.
    :correct: d
    :feedback_a: Not quite, Priority Queues serve a purpose beyond storage.
    :feedback_b: No, the vertices will be sorted.
    :feedback_c: No, it does not store any visited vertices.
    :feedback_d: Correct!

    What purpose does the Priority Queue in the Dijkstra's algorithm serve?
