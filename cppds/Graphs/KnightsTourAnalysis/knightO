    :answer_a: O(k^n)
    :answer_b: O(n)
    :answer_c: O(n^2)
    :answer_d: O(n!)
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: You are correct! K is a small constant, and N is the total number of vertices (or spaces on a chessboard).
    :feedback_b: No, the Knight's Tour is not linear.
    :feedback_c: No, the Knight's Tour does not have a nested loop that iterates through all values twice.
    :feedback_d: No, the input is not processed in a fashion indicative of a factorial.

    What is the big O of the Knight's Tour function?
