   :answer_d: Insertion Sort
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Shell sort is between O(n) and O(n^2)
   :feedback_b: Quick sort can be O(n log n), but if the pivot points are not well chosen and the list is just so, it can be O(n^2).
   :feedback_c: Merge Sort is the only guaranteed O(n log n) even in the worst case. The cost is that merge sort uses more memory.
   :feedback_d: Insertion sort is O(n^2)

   Which of the following sort algorithms are guaranteed to be O(n log n) even in the worst case?
