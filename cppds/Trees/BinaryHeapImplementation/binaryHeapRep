    What is the vector used in the binary tree in the first image of :ref:`Figure 3 <fig_percDown>`? Exclude any whitespace.

    - :0,9,14,11,17,18,19,21,33,27: Is the correct answer!
      :.*9,14,11,17,18,19,21,33,27: Remember what has to be at the beginning of the vector to accurately traverse through the binary tree. Look back at chp. 8.9.2.
      :.*: Refer to section 8.9.1 and 8.9.2
