   Modify the infixToPostfix function above so that it can convert the following expression. Once you have the answer from the code put it in the blank below:  ``5 * 3 /(4 - 2)``.

   |blank|

   -  :5\s+3\s*\*\s*4\s+2\s*\-\s*\/: Correct.
      :5.*3.*5.*4.*2\s+[-/*]*: The numbers appear to be in the correct order check your operators
      :x: Hint: You just need to change one line of code.
