   :answer_a: A stack, because a recursive function will complete the final function call before any of the other function calls, similar to how a stack has the Last-in-First-out principle.
   :answer_b: A queue, because a recursive function will complete its intial function call before any of the other function calls, similar to how a queue has the First-in-First-out principle.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! a recursive function will complete the final function call first, because the rest of the calls are waiting for the results of the calls they made.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Think of it this way, when a function is called and it calls itself, the original function call cannot be completed until the new function call is completed.

   Is the process of stepping through a recursive function similar to the construct of a stack or a queue?
