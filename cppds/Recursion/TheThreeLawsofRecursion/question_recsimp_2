   :feedback_a: There are only five numbers on the vector, the number of recursive calls will not be greater than the size of the vector.
   :feedback_b: The initial call to vectsum is not a recursive call.
   :feedback_c: the first recursive call passes the vector {4,6,8,10}, the second {6,8,10} and so on until [10].
   :feedback_d: This would not be enough calls to cover all the numbers on the vector

   How many recursive calls are made when computing the sum of the vector {2,4,6,8,10}?
