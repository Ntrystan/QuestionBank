   :answer_c: If a recursive function didn't have a base case, then the function would continue to make recursive calls creating an infinite loop.
   :answer_b: If a recursive function didn't have a base case, then the function would return an undesired outcome.
   :answer_a: If a recursive function didn't have a base case, then the function would end too early.
   :answer_d: If a recursive function didn't have a base case, then the function would not be able to ever make recursive calls in the first place.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_c: Correct! a base case is needed to end the continuous recursive calls, so that the program doesn't get stuck in a never ending loop.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. In fact, the program wouldn't return anything.
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. The complete opposite would happen instead.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Recursive calls will continue to be called even without a base case.

   Why is a base case needed in a recursive function?
