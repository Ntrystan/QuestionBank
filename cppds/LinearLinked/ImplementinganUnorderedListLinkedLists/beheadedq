    :answer_a: If you lose the head, the next node becomes the head.
    :answer_b: If you lose the head, the list is still in memory, you just cannot find it.
    :answer_c: It is impossible to lose the head.
    :answer_d: If you lose the head, you lose access to the entire linked list.
    :correct: b, d
    :feedback_a: No, if you lose the head node, your pointer will be pointing at nothing.
    :feedback_b: Yes, this occurs because the delete keyword is never used to get rid of the list.
    :feedback_c: No, if you lose the head node, your pointer will be pointing at nothing.
    :feedback_d: Right, however, it remains in memory, unknown to you.

    What would happen if you lose the head of a singularly-linked linked list?
