        :answer_a: It must be mutable so that it can change at any time.
        :answer_b: Its memory size cannot be too big, relating to how atoms are naturally very small.
        :answer_c: It must be statically allocated so it cannot change in size.
        :answer_d: It cannot be broken down any smaller while still being easily operable.
        :correct: d
        :feedback_a: Incorrect, Atomic data types are not required to be mutable.
        :feedback_b: Incorrect, The data type can be any size, but you're close. (hint: atomic data types got their name when scientists thought atoms were the smallest things in existence.)
        :feedback_c: Incorrect, atomic data types have nothing to do with being static or dynamic.
        :feedback_d: Correct, the atomic data type actually got its name when scientists thought atoms were the smallest things in existence. That is why they are data types that cannot be broken down.

        After reading the above paragraph, what makes a data type categorized as an atomic data type? (hint:
        arrays and vectors are not atomic)
