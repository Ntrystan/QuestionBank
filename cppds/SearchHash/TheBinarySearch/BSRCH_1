   :feedback_a:  Looks like you might be guilty of an off-by-one error.  Remember the first position is index 0.
   :feedback_b:  Binary search starts at the midpoint and halves the list each time.
   :feedback_c: Binary search does not start at the beginning and search sequentially, its starts in the middle and halves the list after each compare.
   :feedback_d: It appears that you are starting from the end and halving the list each time.

   Suppose you have the following sorted list [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18] and are using the recursive binary search algorithm.  Which group of numbers correctly shows the sequence of comparisons used to find the key 8.
