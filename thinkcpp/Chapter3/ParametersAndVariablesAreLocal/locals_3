   Whenever we make a function call, we create a(n) |blank| of that fucntion,
   which contiains the parameters and local variables for that function.

   - :[Ii][Nn][Ss][Tt][Aa][Nn][Cc][Ee]: You could create many instances of one function, each with their own parameters and local variables if you wanted!
