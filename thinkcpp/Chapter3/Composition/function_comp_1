   :answer_a: double x = log2 (12)
   :answer_b: double val = tan (angle + pi/3);
   :answer_c: double num = exp (cos(1.34))
   :answer_d: double y = exp (cosine(9.8)) + exp (tan(4.5));
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: log2 is not a built in cmath function, but you could write an implementation for it if you wanted!
   :feedback_b: This correctly uses cmath functions!
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if it ended in a semi-colon.
   :feedback_d: Make sure to use the math keywords reserved in C++ when using math functions. Using **cosine** instead of *cos* is incorrect.

   Which of these statements has correct syntax?
