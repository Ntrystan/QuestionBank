       double e = 2.71828;
       int eInt = e;
       double eDouble = eInt;
       cout << eDouble;

   What is the value of eDouble printed to the terminal?

   - :2: When we converted e to an int, e was rounded down to 2. When we converted eInt to a double, the decimal places from e were lost, and the value of eDouble remains 2.
     :2\.0: C++ knows that the value of eDouble is 3.0, but it is displayed to the terminal without the extra decimal places.
     :2\.71828: When we converted e to an int, e was rounded down to 2. When we converted eInt to a double, the decimal places from e were lost.
     :.*: Try again!
