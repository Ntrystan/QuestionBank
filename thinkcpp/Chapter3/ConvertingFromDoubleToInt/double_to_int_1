   :feedback_a: This is the name of a variable. Only the value of a variable will print with cout.
   :feedback_b: Remember that converting to an integer always rounds down.
   :feedback_c: Correct!

   In the lab, we measured a temperature of 7.99999999 degrees C, using
   an extremely precise measuring device.  Now we are writing a program
   to perform some calculations with our data.  Consider the following C++
   code.

   ::

       int main () {
         double temp = 7.99999999;
         int roundedTemp = int (temp);
         cout << roundedTemp;
       }

   What is the value of roundedTemp?
