   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: There is an important character that ends nearly all statements in C++.

   Which of the following would be a correct way to display the price of an object and finish the ``printPrice``, which we saw on the previous page?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Price {
        int dollar, cents;
      };

      void printPrice(Price& p) {
        // Implementation here
      }

      int main() {
        Price sandwich = { 3, 45 };
        Price coffee = { 2, 50 };
        Price pastry = { 2, 0 };
      }
