   :answer_a: Almost all programs are written in high-level languages.
   :answer_b: Programs written in a high-level language must be translated before they can be run.
   :answer_c: It's easier to program in a low-level language than a high-level language.
   :answer_d: Computers can only execute programs written in high-level languages.

   :feedback_c: Actually, its much the other way around!
   :feedback_d: Computers actually can't understand high-level languages as they are written.
   :feedback_e: High-level programs are portable, meaning they can run on different kinds of computers with little to no modification.
