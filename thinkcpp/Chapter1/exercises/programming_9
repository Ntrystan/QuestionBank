    **Multiple Response** Which is true about programming languages?

    -   Low-level languages are only used for a few special applications.

        +   Low-level languages take more time to write, and they are much harder to
            understand, so they aren't used often.

    -   Programs written in low-level languages must be translated before they can be run.

        -   Low level languages are already written in a language that your computer
            can understand, so they don't need to be translated!

    -   It's easier to program in a high-level language than a low-level language.

        +   High-level languages take less time to write, they are much easier to
            understand, and they are more likely to be correct!

    -   Computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages.

        +   This is why most programs need to be translated before they can be run!

    -   High-level languages can run on many different kinds of computers without an issue.

        +   This is called portability.
