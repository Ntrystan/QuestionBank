    What is the function of the compiler?

    -   It loads the program from its saved location and makes the computer execute it.

        -   This is the function of an executor.  If you use a compiler, you must also
            use an executer to run your code.

    -   It reads a high-level program and translates everything at once, before executing
        any of the commands.

        +   If there are any errors in your code, the program will not compile.  It is an
            all-or-nothing process.

    -   It translates the program from the low-level language you coded in to a high-level
        language that the computer can understand.

        -   You, the programmer, write your program in a HIGH-level language.  It is then
            translated to a LOW-level language that the computer can understand.

    -   It translates the program line-by-line, alternately reading lines and carrying
        out commands.

        -   This is the function of an interpreter.
