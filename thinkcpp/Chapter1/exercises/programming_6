    What type of error would the following generate?  Assume you are
    trying to calculate the volume of a cylinder:

    ::

        int radius = 7;
        int height = 8
        double volume = 3.14 * r * r * height;

    -   syntax error

        +   You are missing a semicolon on the second line, and you are using
            the variable ``r`` without defining it on the third line.  your
            program will not compile.

    -   run-time error

        -   There are no errors that will surface at runtime.

    -   semantic error

        -   Everything looks good with your volume calculations.

    -   no error

        -   Take a closer look at the structure of the code.
