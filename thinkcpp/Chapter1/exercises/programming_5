    What type of error would the following code cause?  Assume you are
    trying to calculate the volume of a cylinder:

    ::

        int radius = 7;
        int height = 8;
        double volume = 3.14 * radius * height;

    -   syntax error

        -   There is nothing wrong with the structure of this program.

    -   run-time error

        -   There are no errors that will surface at runtime.

    -   semantic error

        +   This is not the correct formula for calculating the volume of a
            cylinder.  This program will go on to calculate the wrong volume
            because it doesn't know any better.

    -   no error

        -   Take a look at the area formula.
