   :answer_d: overriding
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Recursion is when a function calls itself.
   :feedback_b: Debugging is what we do after implementing a function.
   :feedback_c: Overloading is when we have two functions with the same name that take different parameters.
   :feedback_d: Overriding is when an inherited class uses a different method than the base class... more on this later!

   What are the following functions an example of?

   ::

       double price(int x, int y);
       double price(double a, int b, string c);
