   :answer_a: Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so you can output and check them.
   :answer_b: Start with a working program and make small, incremental changes. That way you know exactly where the error is if you have one.
   :answer_c: Writing a program from start to finish, and then debugging at the end in order to understand all of the errors at once.
   :answer_d: Once the program is working, you might want to consolidate some statements into compound expressions, or remove them entirely.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Temporary variables are very useful in understanding what is happening at each step.
   :feedback_b: This is the definition of incremental development.
   :feedback_c: Incremental development uses step by step debugging in order to avoid the difficulty this would present.
   :feedback_d: This is good practice, as long as it doesn't make the program difficult to read.

   Which of the following is **not** a key aspect of the incremental development process?
