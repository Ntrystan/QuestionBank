   :feedback_a: As the programmer, we explicitly call this function one time... but remember, recursive functions call themselves!
   :feedback_b: Not quite! Maybe you were thinking of the two possible branches of the function call.
   :feedback_c: You're close! But what happens when n = 0?
   :feedback_d: The function is called four times total.  Three of those times, the function recurses.  The last time, the function reaches its base case and returns 1.

   In the example above, how many times was the ``factorial`` function
   called?
