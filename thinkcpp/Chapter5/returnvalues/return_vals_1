   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: There are no doubles used in this function.
   :feedback_b: The parameter does not have to be the same type as the return type.
   :feedback_c: The variable "outside" is being returned, which is of string type.
   :feedback_d: The return type is actually a string of chars.

   What should the return type of the below function be?

   ::

       ________ weather (int temp) {
        string outside = "";
        if (temp < 50) {
          outside = "cold";
        }
        else {
          outside = "warm"
        }
        return outside;
       }
