   :answer_a: Since you can find the factorial of the first 3 numbers in a list, you must also be able to find the factorial of the first 2.
   :answer_b: You assume that the log function works, without examining the implementation.
   :answer_c: Since you can take the sum of the first 7 numbers in a list, you assume that you can also take the sum of the first 8.
   :answer_d: You write a function and assume that it will work.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: There is no leap of faith here.  In fact, it's quite flip-flopped.
   :feedback_b: This is a leap of faith, but it is not recursive.
   :feedback_c: Recursive leaps of faith always assume that the recursive call will work.
   :feedback_d: This is a leap of faith, but it is not recursive.

   Which of the following is an example of the recursive leap of faith?
