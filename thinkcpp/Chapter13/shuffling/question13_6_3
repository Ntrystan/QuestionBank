   Let's write the code for the ``swapCards`` function. We'll write ``swapCards``
   as a ``Deck`` member function that takes two indices as parameters.
   -----
   void Deck::swapCards (int index1, int index2) {
   =====
   void Card::swapCards (int index1, int index2) {                         #paired
   =====
      Card temp = cards[index1];
   =====
      cards[index1] = cards[index2];
   =====
      cards[index2] = cards[index1];                         #paired
   =====
      cards[index2] = temp;
   }
