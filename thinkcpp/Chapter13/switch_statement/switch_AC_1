   Take a look at the active code below that allows you to choose your starter Pokemon.
   If you change the value of ``type``, it will change the Pokemon you choose. Notice how
   if you don't assign ``type`` to a valid type, it outputs the default message. Try taking out
   the ``break`` statements in each case. What happens if you run the code with ``type`` as 'g' afterwards?

   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       char type = 'w';

       switch (type) {
       case 'g':
           cout << "You've chosen Bulbasaur!" << endl;
           break;
       case 'f':
           cout << "You've chosen Charmander!" << endl;
           break;
       case 'w':
           cout << "You've chosen Squirtle!" << endl;
          break;
       default:
           cout << "Invalid type! Please try again." << endl;
           break;
       }
   }
