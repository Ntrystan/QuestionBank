   :answer_a: n, nlogn, more efficient
   :answer_b: n^2, nlogn, more efficient
   :answer_c: nlogn, n, less efficient
   :answer_d: nlogn, n^2, less efficient
   :answer_e: n^2, nlogn, less efficient
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Simple sort traverses the vector n times, and each traversal takes additional time.
   :feedback_b: Simple sort takes time proporitonal to n^2, mergesort takes time proportional to nlogn (which is more efficient).
   :feedback_c: You might be confused about which algorithm is which.  Also, what is the efficiency of simple sort?
   :feedback_d: You might be confused about which algorithm is which.
   :feedback_e: Which algorithm is more efficient? (Which function grows more slowly?)

   The efficiency of a simple sorting algorithm is __________.  The
   efficiency of mergesort is __________.  Mergesort is __________ than
   the simple sorting algorithm.
