   :answer_a: after being granted permission
   :answer_b: only inside of that specific member function
   :answer_c: using dot notation
   :answer_d: directly, without dot notation
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! You don't need "permission" to access member variables inside a member function.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! You can access member variables implicitly inside any and all member functions.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! You don't need to use dot notation to access variables implicitly.
   :feedback_d: Correct! Implicit variable access allows us to access variables directly-- without using dot notation.

   Implicit variable access in member functions allows us to access member variables __________.
