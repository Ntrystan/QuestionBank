   :answer_a: double x = corner.box.x;
   :answer_b: double x = box.corner.x;
   :answer_c: double x = corner.x;

   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Try again.
   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: Try again.
   :feedback_d: Try again.

   How can you combine these two statements into one?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      Point temp = box.corner;
      double x = temp.x;
