   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This declaration would not work for the specific code block below.
   :feedback_b: The specific name of the structure should be used, not its type.
   :feedback_c: Yes, we can access and modify the instance variables using the dot operator.
   :feedback_d: The semi-colon is missing at the end.

   Which of the following would be the correct way to initialize the instance variables
   of the ``Point`` object?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Point () {
        double x, y;
      };

      int main() {
        Point nice;
      }
