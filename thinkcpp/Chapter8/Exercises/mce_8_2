    What is wrong with the following ``struct`` definition?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Chicken {
        string name;
        int numLegs;
        int eggs;
        bool eggs;
      }

    - The word "struct" needs to be capitalized.

      - "struct" shouldn't be capitalized in a ``struct`` definition.

    - There needs to be a semicolon after the end curly brace.

      + It is a common error to forgot the semicolon at the end of ``struct`` definitions.

    - The ``struct`` cannot have two instance variables that are both named ``eggs``.

      - One is an ``int`` and one is a ``bool`` so this is allowed.

    - There is nothing wrong with the ``struct`` definition.

      - There is an error with the definition. Can you find it?
