    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Cube {
        int edgeLength;
        int volume;
        int mass;
      };

      int calculateDensity (Cube c) {
        return c.mass / c.volume;
      }

      int main() {
        Cube c = { 2, 8, 4 };
        int density = calculateDensity (c);
        cout << density;
      }

    - 0

      + Because of integer division, ``density`` is 0 and thus the output is 0.

    - 2

      - Density is mass divided by volume.

    - 0.5

      - Take a closer look at what kind of division we are doing.

    - 1

      - Integer division truncates the extra digits.
