    Which of the following are compound values?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Student {
        string firstName, lastName;
        int year;
        double gpa;
      };

      struct Professor {
        string firstName, lastName;
        string department;
        int class;
      };

      int main() {
        Student x = { "John", "Doe", 2, 3.46 };
        Student y = { "Jane", "Doe", 3, 3.68 };
        Professor z = { "Richard", "Roe", "Computer Science", 101 };
        string college = "University of College";
        int studentPop = 3400;
        double avgGPA = 3.2;
      }

    - x

      + ``x`` is a ``Student`` which is a ``struct``.

    - y

      + ``y`` is a ``Student`` which is a ``struct``.

    - z

      + ``z`` is a ``Professor`` which is a ``struct``.

    - college

      + ``college`` is a ``string`` which is made up of characters.

    - studentPop

      - An ``int`` is not a compound value.

    - avgGPA

      - A ``double`` is not a compound value.
