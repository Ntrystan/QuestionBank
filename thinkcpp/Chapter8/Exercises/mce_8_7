    What is the value of ``r.batteryLevelPercentage`` when the code is done running?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Robot {
        string name;
        int batteryLevelPercentage;
        bool isFullyCharged;
      };

      void chargeRobot (Robot& r) {
        if (r.batteryLevelPercentage + 50 > 100) {
          r.batteryLevelPercentage = 100;
          r.isFullyCharged = true;
        }
        else {
          r.batteryLevelPercentage = r.batteryLevelPercentage + 50;
        }
      }

      int main() {
        Robot r = { "Rob", 60, false };
        chargeRobot (r);
      }

    - 100

      + The ``Robot`` object is passed by reference to ``chargeRobot``, which caps the ``batteryLevelPercentage`` at 100.

    - 110

      - Take a closer look at the ``chargeRobot`` function.

    - 60

      - Is the ``Robot`` object passed by value or by reference to ``chargeRobot``?

    - 1

      - That is the final value of ``r.isFullyCharged``.
