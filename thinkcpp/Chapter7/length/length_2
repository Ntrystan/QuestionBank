   :answer_a: o
   :answer_b: r
   :answer_c: s
   :answer_d: Error, s.length() is 12 and there is no index 12.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Take a look at the index calculation again, s.length()-5.
   :feedback_b: Yes, s.length() is 12 and 12-5 is 7.  Use 7 as index and remember to start counting with 0.
   :feedback_c: s is at index 11.
   :feedback_d: You subtract 5 before using the index operator so it will work.


   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      string s = "coding rocks";
      cout << (s[s.length()-5]) << endl;
