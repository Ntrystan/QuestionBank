  :caption: Accessing a string character

  Take a look at the active code below. We extract the character
  at index 1 from string ``fruit`` using ``[`` and ``]``.

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
      string fruit = "banana";
      char letter = fruit[1];
      cout << letter << endl;
  }
