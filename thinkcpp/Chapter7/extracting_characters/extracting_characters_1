   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Don't forget that computer scientists do not start counting at 1!
   :feedback_b: Yes, this would access the letter "b".
   :feedback_c: This would access the letter "k".


   What would replace the "?" in order to access the letter "b" in the string below?

   .. code-block:: cpp
      :linenos:

      #include <iostream>
      using namespace std;

      int main () {
        string bake = "bake a cake!";
        char letter = bake[?];
      }
