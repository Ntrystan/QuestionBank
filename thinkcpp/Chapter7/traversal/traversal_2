   :feedback_b: Yes, i goes through the odd numbers starting at 1.  o is at position 1 and 8.
   :feedback_c: There are 2 o characters but idx does not take on the correct index values for both.


   How many times is the letter o printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      string s = "coding rocks";
      int i = 1;
      int length = s.length();
      while (i < length) {
        cout << s[i] << endl;
        i = i + 2;
      }
