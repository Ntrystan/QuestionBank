   Try writing the ``reverseWord`` function in the commented section
   of the active code below. If done correctly, the program should output "hello"
   backwards. If you get stuck, you can reveal the extra problem at the end for help.

   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void reverseWord (string word) {
       // ``reverseWord`` should take the letters of ``word``
       // and output them in reverse.
   }

   int main() {
       reverseWord("hello");
   }
