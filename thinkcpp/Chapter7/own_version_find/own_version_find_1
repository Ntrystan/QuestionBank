   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Notice how the built-in find function works differently from ours.
   :feedback_b: Remember that when a character isn't found, the function returns -1.
   :feedback_c: Keep in mind that the find function is case sensitive, so "A" is different from "a".
   :feedback_d: Remember that indexing begins at 0 for C++.

   What is the correct output of the code below?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      int main() {
        string quote = "The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.";
        cout << find(quote, 't', 11) << ", " << find(quote, 't', 42) << ", " << quote.find('t');
      }
