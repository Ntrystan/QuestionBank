   The program below should print out the number of occurences of the character 't'
   in the string tongue_twister but the code is mixed up. Put the necessary blocks
   in the correct order, with declaration in the order of tongue_twister, count, and i.
   -----
   int main() {
   =====
      string tongue_twister = "twelve twins twirled twelve twigs";
   =====
      int count = 0;
   =====
      int count = 1;  #paired
   =====
      int i = 0;
   =====
      while (i < tongue_twister.length()) {
   =====
         if (tongue_twister[i] == 't') {
   =====
         if (tongue_twister[i] = 't') {  #paired
   =====
            count++;
         }
   =====
         i++;
      }
   =====
      cout << count;
   }
