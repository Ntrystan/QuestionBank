   The following is the correct code for printing the even numbers from 0 to 10, but it also includes some extra code that you won't need. Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.
   -----
   x = x + 1; #distractor
   =====
   x = 0;
   =====
   while (x <= 10) {
   =====
   while (x < 10) { #distractor
   =====
      cout << x << endl;
   =====
      x = x + 2;
   }
