    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       string call = "Marco!";
       string response = "Polo!";
       string output = "call" + "response";
       cout << output;
     }

    - Marco! Polo!

      - Take a closer look at the initialization of ``output``.

    - Marco!Polo!

      - Take a closer look at the initialization of ``output``.

    - call response

      - Can we concatenate "call" and "response"?

    - callresponse

      - Can we concatenate "call" and "response"?

    - Error, we cannot concatenate native C strings.

      + We cannot concatenate "call" and "response", so this code results in an error.
