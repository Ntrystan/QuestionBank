       int index = find (quote, 'w', quote.find("wood") + 1);
       cout << index;
     }

      - Take a closer look at the starting index for where we should start looking.

      + After the first 'w', the second 'w' appears at index 22.

    - 43

      - Take a closer look at the ``find`` function and its arguments.

    - 65
