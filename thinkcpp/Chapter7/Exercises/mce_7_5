    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       string quote = "With great power comes great responsiblity.";
       int n = 0;
       while (n < quote.length()) {
         if (n % 5 == 0) {
           cout << quote[n];
         }
         n++;
       }
     }

    - teeest

      - Remember that indexing begins at 0 in C++.

    - Wg reeest

      + If we print out every fifth character, including the first, this is the answer.

    - ith reatpowe coms grat rsponibliy.

      - This is what we would get if we removed every fifth character.

    - With great power comes great responsiblity.

      - Take a look at the conditional in the while loop.
