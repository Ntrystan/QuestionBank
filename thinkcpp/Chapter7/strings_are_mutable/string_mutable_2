   :answer_a: message[9] = "w";
   :answer_b: message[10] = "w";
   :answer_c: "w" = message[9];
   :answer_d: message[8] = "w";
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Since "l" is at index 9, replacing it with "w" fixes the message.
   :feedback_b: Remember indexing starts at 0.
   :feedback_c: In order to change a letter in a string, the ``[]`` operator must be on the left of the assignment.
   :feedback_d: Remember indexing starts at 0.

   How can we fix the message to be "You're a wizard Harry"?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      string message = "You're a lizard Harry";
