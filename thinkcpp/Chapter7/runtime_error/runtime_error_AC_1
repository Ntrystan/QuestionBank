   Running the active code below will result in a runtime error. Can you fix
   it so that we print out the first letter and last letter of string ``greeting`` instead
   of indexing out of range?
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       string greeting = "Hello world";
       cout << "The first letter is " << greeting[-1] << endl;
       cout << "The last letter is " << greeting[greeting.length()] << endl;
   }
