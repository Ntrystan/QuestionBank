   :answer_d: none of the above
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! This is what gets returned by nums.size()
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! This is the element before nums[nums.size()]
   :feedback_c: Incorrect!
   :feedback_d: Correct! This would be indexing out of bounds and would cause a runtime error.

   Let **nums** be the vector { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }. What is the value *at* ``nums[nums.size()]``?
