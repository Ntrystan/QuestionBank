   :correct: c,e
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! This is actually incrementing the 4th element of **vec**, since vectors are zero indexed.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! This is not proper syntax.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! This is not proper syntax.
   :feedback_e: Correct!

   How would you increment the third element of ``vector<int> vec`` by one?
