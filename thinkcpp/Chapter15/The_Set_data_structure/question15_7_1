   :answer_a: the set grows to accomodate any new elements we add
   :answer_b: the set is sorted in an order (ie alphabetically, numerically, e.t.c.)
   :answer_c: elements of the set have indices, which can be used to identify them
   :answer_d: there is a limit on how large a set can be
   :answer_e: there are no repeat elements in the set
   :correct: a,c,e
   :feedback_a: Correct! This is the "arbitrary size" property.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! This is not a requirement of a set.
   :feedback_c: Correct! This is the "ordering" property.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! This is not a requirement of a set... in fact, sets are always expanding with each added element!
   :feedback_e: Correct! This is the uniqueness property!

   Which of the following are properties of an ordered set?
