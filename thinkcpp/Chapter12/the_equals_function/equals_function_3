   In a card game called Euchre, the highest ranked suit is called the trump suit.  The trump suit contains
   all of the cards of that suit, and the Jack of the other suit of the same color.  For example, if Hearts
   was trump, the trump suit would contain all Hearts, and the Jack of Diamonds.  Implement the is_trump()
   function that returns true of a Card is part of the trump suit.  Assume we have a helper function same_color()
   that returns the other suit of the same color.

   bool Card::is_trump (string trump_suit) {
   =====
    if (suit == trump_suit) {
     return true;
    }

    if (suit != trump_suit) {                         #paired
     return false;
    }

    else if (rank == "Jack" && suit == same_color()) {
     return true;
