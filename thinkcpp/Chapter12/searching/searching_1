   Say we have standard deck of cards. According to our ``find()`` function, the
   for loop will execute a minimum of |blank| times, and a maximum of |blank|
   times while searching for a particular card.

   - :1: Correct!
     :x: Incorrect! What if the card we were searching for was the first one in the deck?
   - :52: Correct!
     :.*: Incorrect! What if the card we were searching for wasn't in the deck? In this case, we'd have looped through all of the cards!
