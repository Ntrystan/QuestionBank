   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: Yes, because the mappings should be easy for the programmer to remember.
   :answer_b: Yes, because the mappings should be easy for the user to remember.
   :answer_c: No! All input and output uses human-readable formats, so the programmer doesn't need to understand what is going on behind the scenes.
   :answer_d: No! All input and output uses human-readable formats, so the user doesn't need to understand what is going on behind the scenes.
   :correct: a,d
   :feedback_a: Correct! The programmer should uses mappings that are easy to remember (even if this means we don't use the zeroeth element of the ranks vector).
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! The user doesn't need to know how things are mapped.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! The programmer should always know what is going on with their code.
   :feedback_d: Correct! The user doesn't need to know how the programmer coded things.

   Does it matter how we encode a mapping?
