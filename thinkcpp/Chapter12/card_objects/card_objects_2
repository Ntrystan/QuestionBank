   :answer_a: To translate each rank / suit into a secret code.
   :answer_b: To create apstrings to represent each rank / suit.
   :answer_c: To define a mapping between each rank / suit and a sequence of numbers.
   :answer_d: To write code describing real objects, like cards, with their respective ranks / suits.

   :feedback_a: Incorrect! This is called encryption.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! We create apstrings before we encode.
   :feedback_c: Correct! This makes it easier to compare cards.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! This is how we describe object-oriented programming.

   What does it mean to **encode** the ranks and suits?
