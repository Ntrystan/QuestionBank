    If we actually created the deck in the previous question, what is printed after the following code runs?

    ::

     deck[11].print();

    Type your answer exactly as it would appear in the terminal!

    - :(7 of Diamonds): Correct!
      :.*: Incorrect, try modifying the activecode and writing a print statement!
