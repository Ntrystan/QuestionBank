   :from_source: T
   :answer_a: It prevents unrestricted access to the instance variables by making them private.
   :answer_b: It allows users to directly modify private member variables.
   :answer_c: It makes it so that private data members can never be modified by any function.
   :answer_d: It eliminates the need for invariants.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! Users must instead use accessor functions to access them.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! Try again.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! Try again.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! Try again.

   How does data encapsulation help us enforce invariants?
