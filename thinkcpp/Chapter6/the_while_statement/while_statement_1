   :answer_b: n != 0
   :answer_c: n % 2 == 1
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: A single equal sign is the assignment operator, not comparison.
   :feedback_b: This would be valid because it means the loop would run while n is not equal to 0.
   :feedback_c: This would be valid because it mean the loop would run until n was an even number.


   Which of the following is NOT a valid condition for a while statement?
