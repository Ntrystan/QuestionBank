  Try running the active code below! Afterwards, try changing 9 to a different
  integer to see how the function works!

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  void countdown (int n) {
      while (n > 0) {
          cout << n << endl;
          n = n-1;
      }
      cout << "Blastoff!" << endl;
  }

  int main() {
      countdown (9);
  }
