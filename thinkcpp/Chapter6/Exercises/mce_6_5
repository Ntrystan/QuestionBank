    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       int n = 10;
       cout << "Da ";
       cout << "na ";
       while (n != 3) {
         cout << "na ";
       }
       cout << "Batman!";
     }

    - Batman!

      - Take a closer look at the while loop.

    - Da Batman!

      - Take a closer look at the while loop.

    - Da na na na na na na na na Batman!

      - Take a closer look at the while loop.

    - The end condition is never met, so it will result in an infinite loop.

      + Since we never change the value of ``n``, 10 will never equal 3 so the code will run forever.
