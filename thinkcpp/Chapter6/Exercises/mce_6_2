    What is the final value of ``i`` when the code is finished running?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       int x = 0;
       int i = 1;
       while (i < 10) {
         x = i;
         i++;
       }
       cout << x;
     }

    - 0

      - ``i`` is initialized with a value of 1 and is incremented, so it will never have a value of 0.

    - 1

      - ``i`` is initialized with a value of 1 but it is incremented during the while loop.

    - 9

      - This is the final value of ``x`` when the code is finished running.

    - 10

      + In order for the while loop to terminate, the condition ``i < 10`` must be false, and this is achieved when ``i`` is incremented to 10.
