   :caption: Condensing The Code

   This program does the same thing as the previous, but the print
   statements have been condensed to one line.  This is better style.

   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main () {
       int hour, minute;
       char colon;

       hour = 11;
       minute = 59;
       colon = ':';

       cout << "The current time is " << hour << colon << minute << endl;

       return 0;
   }
