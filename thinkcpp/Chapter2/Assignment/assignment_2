   :answer_a: Change the type of variable q from int to char.
   :answer_b: Change the type of both variables (p and q) from int to char.
   :answer_c: Change the type of variable p from int to char.
   :answer_d: Nothing needs to change! The code will work just fine!
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Yes, but take a look at variable p.
   :feedback_b: Both variables are a character surrounded by single quotes, so they should be type char.
   :feedback_c: Yes, but take a look at variable q.
   :feedback_d: No! There will be a compile error.

   What must be changed in order for this code block to work?

   ::

       #include <iostream>
       using namespace std;
       // main: generate some simple output

       int main () {
         int p;
         int q;
         p = 'h';
         q = '9';
       }
