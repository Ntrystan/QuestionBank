    What is the output of the following code block?

    ::

       int main() {
         string apples;
         apples = "bananas";
         string pineapple;
         string mango = "mango";
         pineapple = apples;
         cout << "My favorite fruit is ";
         cout << pineapple << endl;
         pineapple = mango;
       }

    -   ``My favorite fruit is pineapple``

        -   ``pineapple`` is the name of the variable, but it's not necessarily
            the value of that variable.

    -   ``My favorite fruit is bananas``

        +   ``pineapple = apples``, and ``apples = "bananas"``.

    -   ``My favorite fruit is apples``

        -   ``pineapple = apples``, but what does ``apples`` equal?

    -   ``My favorite fruit is `mango``

        -   ``"mango"`` is the value of the variable ``pineapple`` at the end of
            ``main``, but not at the line of the ``cout``.

    -   Compile error.

        -   There are no syntax errors that will cause an issue compiling.
