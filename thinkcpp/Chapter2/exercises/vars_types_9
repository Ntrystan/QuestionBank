    What line does the first error occur in the following program?
    If there is no error, what is the output?

    .. code-block::
       :linenos:

       int main() {
         char r = 'r';
         int x = 3;
         r = r + x;
         cout << r;
       }

    -   line 2, a variable cannot have the same name as its value

        -   A variable can have any value... as long as the types are
            the same.

    -   line 4, you cannot add an integer to a character

        -   Actually, C++ supports character operations!  This is legal.

    -   No error, ``rx``

        -   ``x`` is an integer, so what we really have is ``r = r + 3``.

    -   No error, ``r``

        -   ``'r'`` isn't necessarily the value of ``r``.  Take a look at line 4.

    -   No error, ``u``

        +   'u' is three letters after 'r', so on line 4, the value of ``u`` becomes
            the value of ``r``.
