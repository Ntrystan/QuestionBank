   Construct a code block that prints the total cost of your meal,
   including the 6.0% sales tax, after you purchase two orders of
   fries, three burgers, and a milkshake.  Start by initializing
   the value of sales tax, then the prices of the food.  Once you
   have initialized the variables, you can perform your calculations
   and save the result in the price variable.  At the very end, you
   will print out the total price.

    double tax = 0.06;

    double fries, milkshake, burger;

   =====
    fries = 2.50;
    milkshake = 3.75;
    burger = 3.00;
   =====
    double price = 2 * fries + 3 * burger + milkshake;
   =====
    double priceWithTax = price + price * tax;
   =====
    double priceWithTax = price * tax; #paired

    cout << "The total cost of your meal is $";
