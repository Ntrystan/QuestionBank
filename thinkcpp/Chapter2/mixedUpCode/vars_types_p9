   It's Black Friday and the game system you'be been saving up for is marked
   down 60%!  Construct a block of code that calculates how much money
   you'd be saving if the system originally costed $359.99?

   -----
   int main() {
   =====
    double game = 359.99;
   =====
    double game = $359.99; #paired
   =====
    int game = 359.99; #paired
   =====
    double discountPrice = game * 0.60;
   =====
    double discountPrice = game / 0.60; #paired
   =====
    double moneySaved = game - discountPrice;
   =====
    double moneySaved = discountPrice; #paired
   =====
    double moneySaved = game + discountPrice; #paired
   =====
   }
