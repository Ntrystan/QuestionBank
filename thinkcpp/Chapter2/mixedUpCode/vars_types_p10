   Your family just bought a dog and everyone has been fighting over
   what to name it.  It went from Champ to Copper to Higgins, and after
   a few days of being Higgins, everyone agreed on Buddy.  Construct
   a block of code that illustrates this concept.

   -----
   int main() {
   =====
    string name = "Champ";
   =====
    string name = 'Champ'; #paired
   =====
    name = "Copper";
   =====
    string name = "Copper"; #paired
   =====
    string newName = "Higgins";
    name = newName;
   =====
    string name = "Higgins"; #paired
   =====
    name = "Buddy";
   =====
    string name = "Buddy"; #paired
   =====
    name = "Buddy": #paired
   =====
   }
