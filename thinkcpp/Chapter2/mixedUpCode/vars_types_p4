   You decide to make homemade Mac 'n' Cheese for you and your
   roomates.  Whoever wrote the recipe wanted to make things hard
   for you by stating that it calls for 1% of a gallon of milk.
   Construct a block of code that converts this to tablespoons.

   int main() {
   =====
    double gallons = 0.01;
   =====
    int gallons = 0.01; #paired

    int gallons = 0.01 #paired

    double cups = 16 * gallons;
