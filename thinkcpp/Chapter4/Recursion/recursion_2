   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: If we start at zero, will the function ever call itself?
   :feedback_b: If we start at zero, will the function ever call itself?
   :feedback_c: The only output statement in this program prints a "!", therefore "0" would never print.
   :feedback_d: Correct! The program never enters the "if" statement within the function because n is never greater than 0.

   What will print?

   ::

       #include <iostream>
       using namespace std;

       void exclamationPoint(int n) {
         if (n > 0) {
           cout << "!";
           exclamationPoint (n-1);
         }
       }

       int main () {
         exclamationPoint(0);
       }
