   :feedback_a: That statement would print if degrees was less than 50.
   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: One of the statements is satisfied, so something does print.
   :feedback_d: There is nothing in the code below that would generate an error.

   What will be printed after the main is executed?

   ::

       void weather(int temp) {
         if temp < 52 {
           cout << "It is cold!";
         }
         else {
           cout << "It is warm!";
         }
       }

       int main() {
         int degrees = 52;
         weather(degrees);
       }
