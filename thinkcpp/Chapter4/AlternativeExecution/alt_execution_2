   Construct a block of code that correctly goes through alternative
   execution for pricing of an entre at a nice restaurant.  If the
   price is more than $30.00, print "Expensive!".  If the price is
   less than $30.00, print "Inexpensive!"  You should by initializing
   the cost to $40.
   -----
   int cost = 40;

   if (cost > 30) {

   if (cost > 30) #distractor

    cout << "Expensive!";

   } //"if" bracket

   else {

   else if { #distractor

    cout << "Inexpensive!" #distractor

    cout << "Inexpensive!";

   } //"else" bracket
