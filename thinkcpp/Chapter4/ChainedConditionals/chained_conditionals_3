   :feedback_a: Make note of the use of "if" instead of "else if" or "else".
   :feedback_b: When we have "if" statments, but no "else if" or "else", every condition will be checked.
   :feedback_c: The first statement will not be executed because x > 8 is not true.  Also, make note of the use of "if" instead of "else if" or "else".
   :feedback_d: The first statement will not be executed because x > 8 is not true.

   What will print after the following code is executed?

   ::

       #include <iostream>
       using namespace std;

       int main () {
         int x = 7;
         if (x > 8) {
           cout << "One! " ;
         }
         if (x > 6) {
           cout << "Two! ";
         }
         if (x > 3) {
           cout << "Three!" << endl;
         }
         return 0;
       }
