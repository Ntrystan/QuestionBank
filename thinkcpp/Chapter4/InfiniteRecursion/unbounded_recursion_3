   :answer_a: The function will print "Not Negative!"
   :answer_b: The function will print "Not Negative!" more than once.  Then it will print "Negative!" and will stop executing.
   :answer_c: The function will print "Negative!"
   :answer_d: The function will never stop executing, there will be infinite recursion.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: The function will print "Not Negative!", but it won't stop there!
   :feedback_b: The function will print "Not Negative!" until it reaches a negative number.
   :feedback_c: The function will eventually print "Not Negative!", but that's not all!
   :feedback_d: Since we decrement each time, the base case will be reached.

   Suppose we have already defined isNegative (see previous question).
   What will happen if we run the code with this input?

   ::

       #include <iostream>
       using namespace std;

       int main() {
         isNegative(10);
       }
