   :feedback_a: If nLines could reach its base case, it cannot be done in 3 function calls.
   :feedback_b: If nLines could reach its base case, it cannot be done in 4 function calls.
   :feedback_c: If nLines could reach its base case, it could be done in 5 function calls, but does it ever reach the base case?
   :feedback_d: The nLines function never reaches its base case, so the stack diagram would be infinitely long.

   Refer to the ``nLines`` function below.  It is the same as the ``nLines``
   function defined on the previous page.  How many instances of ``nLines``
   would there be in the stack diagram if we begin with n = 4?

   ::

       void nLines(int n) {
         if (n > 0) {
           cout << endl;
           nLines(n + 1);
         }
       }
