   :answer_a: Hey!
   :answer_b: Hi!
   :answer_c: Hello!
   :answer_d: Nothing will print.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Remember that the program would only enter the first "if" if x was equal to 0.
   :feedback_b: Remember that the program would only enter the nested "if" if x was greater than 0.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: Only one of the condtionals will execute, but something will print, regardless of which one it is.

   What will print?
