   :feedback_b: z > m is true, and m > m is false, so a student with these initials would be seated in the back right.
   :feedback_c: z > m is true because z comes after m.  Also, the > opearator is not inclusive.

   Your school uses a system to arrange students in a large stadium using
   their initials.  Look at the function definition below.  Where would a
   student with the initials "MZ" be seated?

   ::

       string seatingArrangement(char first, char last) {
         if (last > m) {
           if (first > m) {
             return "Back Left!";
           }
           esle {
             return "Back Right!";
           }
         }
         else {
           if (first > m) {
             return "Front Left!";
           }
           else {
             return "Front Right!";
           }
         }
       }
