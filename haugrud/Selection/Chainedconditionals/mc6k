   :feedback_a: While the value in x is less than the value in y (3 is less than 5) it is not less than the value in z (3 is not less than 2).
   :feedback_b: The value in y is not less than the value in x (5 is not less than 3).
   :feedback_c: Since the first two Boolean expressions are false the else will be executed.

   What will the following code print if x = 3, y = 5, and z = 2?

   .. code-block:: python

     if x < y and x < z:
         print("a")
     elif y < x and y < z:
         print("b")
     else:
         print("c")
