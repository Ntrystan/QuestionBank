   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The 3n+1 sequence has not been proven to terminate for all values of n.
   :feedback_b: It has not been disproven that the 3n+1 sequence will terminate for all values of n.  In other words, there might be some value for n such that this sequence does not terminate. We just have not found it yet.
   :feedback_c: That this sequence terminates for all values of n has not been proven or disproven so no one knows whether the while loop will always terminate or not.

   Consider the code that prints the 3n+1 sequence in the above ActiveCode.  Will the while loop in this code always terminate for any positive integer value of n?
