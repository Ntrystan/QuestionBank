   :feedback_a: Programmers rarely find all the syntax errors, there is a computer program that will do it for us.
   :feedback_b: The compiler and / or interpreter is a computer program that determines if your program is written in a way that can be translated into machine language for execution.
   :feedback_c: Well, sort of.  But it is a special thing in the computer that does it.  The stand alone computer without this additional piece can not do it.
   :feedback_d: Your teacher and instructor may be able to find most of your syntax errors, but only because they have experience looking at code and possibly writing code.  With experience syntax errors are easier to find.  But we also have an automated way of finding these types of errors.


   Who or what typically finds syntax errors?
