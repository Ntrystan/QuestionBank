      :feedback_a: Python gives number the value of items in the list, one at a time, in order (from left to right).  number gets a new value each time the loop repeats.
      :feedback_b: Yes, Python will process the items from left to right so the first time the value of number is 5 and the second time it is 4.
      :feedback_c: Python gives number the value of items in the list, one at a time, in order.  number gets a new value each time the loop repeats.
      :feedback_d: Python gives number the value of items in the list, one at a time, in order (from left to right).  number gets a new value each time the loop repeats.

      In the following code, what is the value of number the second time Python executes the loop?

      .. code-block:: python

         for number in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]:
             print("I have", number, "cookies.  I'm going to eat one.")
