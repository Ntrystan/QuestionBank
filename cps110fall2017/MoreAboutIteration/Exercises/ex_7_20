   After you have scaled an image too much it looks blocky.  One way of
   reducing the blockiness of the image is to replace each pixel with the
   average values of the pixels around it.  This has the effect of smoothing
   out the changes in color.  Write a function that takes an image as a
   parameter and smooths the image.  Your function should return a new image
   that is the same as the old but smoothed.
