   :feedback_a: Because all three values are close to 0, the color will be dark.  But because the red value is higher than the other two, the color will appear red.
   :feedback_b: The closer the values are to 0, the darker the color will appear.
   :feedback_c: The first value in RGB is the red value.  The second is the green.  This color has no green in it.
   :feedback_d: The first value in RGB is the red value.  The second is the green.  This color has no green in it.

   If you have a pixel whose RGB value is (50, 0, 0), what color will this pixel appear to be?
