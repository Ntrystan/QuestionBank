   :answer_a: To improve the speed of execution
   :answer_b: To help the programmer organize programs into chunks that match how they think about the solution to the problem.
   :answer_c: All Python programs must be written using functions
   :answer_d: To calculate values.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Functions have little effect on how fast the program runs.
   :feedback_b: While functions are not required, they help the programmer better think about the solution by organizing pieces of the solution into logical chunks that can be reused.
   :feedback_c: In the first several chapters, you have seen many examples of Python programs written without the use of functions.  While writing and using functions is desirable and essential for good programming style as your programs get longer, it is not required.
   :feedback_d: Not all functions calculate values.

   What is one main purpose of a function?
