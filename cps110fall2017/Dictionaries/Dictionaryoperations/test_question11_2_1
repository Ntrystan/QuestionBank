   :feedback_c: Yes, add the value for cat and the value for dog (12 + 6) and create a new entry for mouse.

   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. sourcecode:: python

     mydict = {"cat":12, "dog":6, "elephant":23}
     mydict["mouse"] = mydict["cat"] + mydict["dog"]
     print(mydict["mouse"])
