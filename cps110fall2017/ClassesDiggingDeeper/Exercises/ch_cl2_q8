   In games, we often put a rectangular "bounding box" around our sprites in
   the game.  We can then do *collision detection* between, say, bombs and
   spaceships, by comparing whether their rectangles overlap anywhere.

   Write a function to determine whether two rectangles collide. *Hint:
   this might be quite a tough exercise!  Think carefully about all the
   cases before you code.*
