   In Robert McCloskey's
   book *Make Way for Ducklings*, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack,
   Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack.  This loop tries to output these names in order.

   .. sourcecode:: python

        prefixes = "JKLMNOPQ"
        suffix = "ack"

        for p in prefixes:
            print(p + suffix)


   Of course, that's not quite right because Ouack and Quack are misspelled.
   Can you fix it?
