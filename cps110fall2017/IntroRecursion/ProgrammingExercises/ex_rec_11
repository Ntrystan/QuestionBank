   Write a program that solves the following problem: Three missionaries
   and three cannibals come to a river and find a boat that holds two
   people. Everyone must get across the river to continue on the
   journey. However, if the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on
   either bank, the missionaries will be eaten. Find a series of
   crossings that will get everyone safely to the other side of the
   river.
