   Write a function which is given an exam mark, and it returns a string --- the grade for that mark --- according to this
   scheme:

   .. table::

      =======   =====
      Mark      Grade
      =======   =====
      >= 90     A
      [80-90)   B
      [70-80)   C
      [60-70)   D
      < 60      F
      =======   =====

   The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals.
   A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it.   So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.

   Test your function by printing the mark and the grade for a number of different marks.
   ~~~~
    def getGrade(grade):
          #your code here

            self.assertEqual(getGrade(79.99999),'C','Tested getGrade on input of 79.9999')
            self.assertEqual(getGrade(80),'B','Tested getGrade on input of 80')
