   :answer_b: FALSE
   :answer_c: TRUE on one line and FALSE on the next
   :answer_d: Nothing will be printed
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: TRUE is printed by the if-block, which only executes if the conditional (in this case, 4+5 == 10) is true.  In this case 5+4 is not equal to 10.
   :feedback_b: Since 4+5==10 evaluates to False, Python will skip over the if block and execute the statement in the else block.
   :feedback_c: Python would never print both TRUE and FALSE because it will only execute one of the if-block or the else-block, but not both.
   :feedback_d: Python will always execute either the if-block (if the condition is true) or the else-block (if the condition is false).  It would never skip over both blocks.

   What does the following code print (choose from output a, b, c or nothing)?

   .. code-block:: python

     if 4 + 5 == 10:
         print("TRUE")
     else:
         print("FALSE")
