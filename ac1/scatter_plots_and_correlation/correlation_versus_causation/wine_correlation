   Suppose we found a correlation of ``r = -0.48`` between red wine consumption
   and incidence of heart attacks. Which of the following would be appropriate
   conclusions?

   - Drinking red wine reduces the probability of heart attack.

     - Incorrect: Red wine does not prevent a heart attack.

   - Drinking red wine increases the probability of heart attack.

     - Incorrect: Red wine is not the cause of a heart attack.

   - Drinking red wine is associated with a reduction in heart attack risk

     + Correct

   - Having a heart attack decreases the probability of drinking red wine.

     - Incorrect: The heart attack itself does not decrease the consumption of red wine.
