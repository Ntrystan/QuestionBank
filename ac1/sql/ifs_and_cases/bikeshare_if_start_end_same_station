   Write a query, using ``IF``, to count the number of trips of member type
   *Casual* for trips that start and end at the same station compared to trips
   that start and end at different stations. Hint: Your query should have only
   2 columns in the ``SELECT`` clause and only one ``WHERE`` clause.
