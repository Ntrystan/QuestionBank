   Using the scatter plot above, which school will have a lower completion rate?
   (Specifically, which school will have fewer students graduating within
   6 years?)

   - School A

     + Correct: Because the direction of the scatter plot is negative, the
       school with the higher percentage of students with federal loans will
       have a lower completion rate. So College A will have a lower percentage
       of students graduating within 6 years.

   - School B

     - Incorrect: Try again! Because the direction of the scatter plot is
       negative, the school with the higher percentage of students with federal
       loans will have a lower completion rate. So, College A will have a lower
       percentage of students graduating within 6 years.
