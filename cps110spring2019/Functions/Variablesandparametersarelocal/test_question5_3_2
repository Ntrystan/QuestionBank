   :feedback_a: Yes, a local variable is a temporary variable that is only known (only exists) in the function it is defined in.
   :feedback_b: While parameters may be considered local variables, functions may also define and use additional local variables.
   :feedback_c: Variables that are used outside a function are not local, but rather global variables.
