   :answer_a: def drawSquare(t, sz)
   :answer_b: drawSquare
   :answer_c: drawSquare(10)
   :answer_d: drawSquare(alex, 10):
   :answer_e: drawSquare(alex, 10)
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: No, t and sz are the names of the formal parameters to this function.  When the function is called, it requires actual values to be passed in.
   :feedback_b: A function call always requires parentheses after the name of the function.
   :feedback_c: This function takes two parameters (arguments)
   :feedback_d: A colon is only required in a function definition.  It will cause an error with a function call.
   :feedback_e: Since alex was already previously defined and 10 is a value, we have passed in two correct values for this function.

   Considering the function below, which of the following statements correctly invokes, or calls, this function (i.e., causes it to run)?  Assume we already have a turtle named alex.

   .. code-block:: python

     def drawSquare(t, sz):
         """Make turtle t draw a square of with side sz."""
         for i in range(4):
             t.forward(sz)
             t.left(90)
