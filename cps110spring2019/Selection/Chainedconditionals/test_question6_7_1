   :answer_d: II and III
   :answer_e: I, II, and III
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: You can not use a Boolean expression after an else.
   :feedback_b: Yes, II will give the same result.
   :feedback_c: No, III will not give the same result.  The first if statement will be true, but the second will be false, so the else part will execute.
   :feedback_d: No, Although II is correct III will not give the same result.  Try it.
   :feedback_e: No, in I you can not have a Boolean expression after an else.

   Which of I, II, and III below gives the same result as the following nested if?

   .. code-block:: python

     # nested if-else statement
     x = -10
     if x < 0:
         print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
     else:
         if x > 0:
             print(x, " is a positive number")
         else:
             print(x, " is 0")


   .. code-block:: python

     I.

     if x < 0:
         print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
     else x > 0:
         print(x, " is a positive number")
     else:
         print(x, " is 0")


   .. code-block:: python

     II.

     if x < 0:
         print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
     elif x > 0:
         print(x, " is a positive number")
     else:
         print(x, " is 0")

   .. code-block:: python

     III.

     if x < 0:
         print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
     if x > 0:
         print(x, " is a positive number")
     else:
         print(x, " is 0")
