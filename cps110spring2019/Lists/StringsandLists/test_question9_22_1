   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Three characters but not the right ones.  namelist is the list of names.
   :feedback_b: Too many characters in this case.  There should be a single letter from each name.
   :feedback_c: Yes, split creates a list of the three names.  The for loop iterates through the names and creates a string from the first characters.
   :feedback_d: That does not make any sense.

   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

     myname = "Edgar Allan Poe"
     namelist = myname.split()
     init = ""
     for aname in namelist:
         init = init + aname[0]
     print(init)
