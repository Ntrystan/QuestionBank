  :answer_a: Range should generate a sequence that stops before 10 (including 9).
  :answer_b: Range should generate a sequence that starts at 10 (including 10).
  :answer_c: Range should generate a sequence starting at 3 that stops at 10 (including 10).
  :answer_d: Range should generate a sequence using every 10th number between the start and the stopping number.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Range will generate the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9.
  :feedback_b: The first argument (3) tells range what number to start at.
  :feedback_c: Range will always stop at the number in the sequence before (not including) the specified limit for the sequence.
  :feedback_d: The third argument (2) tells range how many numbers to skip between each element in the sequence.

  In the command range(3, 10, 2), what does the second argument (10) specify?
