   :feedback_a: This code would turn the turtle to the south before drawing
   :feedback_b: This code would turn the turtle to the west before drawing
   :feedback_c: This code would turn the turtle to the south before drawing
   :feedback_d: This code is almost correct, but the short end would be facing east instead of west.
   :feedback_e: Yes, the turtle starts facing east, so to turn it north you can turn left 90 or right 270 degrees.

   Which of the following code would produce the following image?
