   Pascal’s triangle is a number triangle with numbers arranged in
   staggered rows such that

   .. math::
      a_{nr} = {n! \over{r! (n-r)!}}

   This equation is the equation for a binomial coefficient. You can
   build Pascal’s triangle by adding the two numbers that are diagonally
   above a number in the triangle. An example of Pascal’s triangle is
   shown below.

   ::

                         1
                       1   1
                     1   2   1
                   1   3   3   1
                 1   4   6   4   1

   Write a program that prints out Pascal’s triangle. Your program
   should accept a parameter that tells how many rows of the triangle to
   print.
