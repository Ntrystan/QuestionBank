   :feedback_a: It is perfectly valid to return the result of evaluating a Boolean expression.
   :feedback_b: x +y < z is a valid Boolean expression, which will evaluate to True or False.  It is perfectly legal to return True or False from a function, and to have the statement to be evaluated in the same line as the return keyword.

   Is the following statement legal in a Python function (assuming x, y and z are defined to be numbers)?

   .. code-block:: python

     return x + y < z
