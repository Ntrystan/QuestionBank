   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: 3 == 4
   :answer_c: 3 + 4
   :answer_d: 3 + 4 == 7
   :answer_e: &quot;False&quot;
   :correct: a,b,d
   :feedback_a: True and False are both Boolean literals.
   :feedback_b: The comparison between two numbers via == results in either True or False (in this case False),  both Boolean values.
   :feedback_c:  3 + 4 evaluates to 7, which is a number, not a Boolean value.
   :feedback_d: 3 + 4 evaluates to 7.  7 == 7 then evaluates to True, which is a Boolean value.
   :feedback_e: With the double quotes surrounding it, False is interpreted as a string, not a Boolean value.  If the quotes had not been included, False alone is in fact a Boolean value.

   Which of the following is a Boolean expression?  Select all that apply.
