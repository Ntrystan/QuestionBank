   Assign to a variable in your program a triple-quoted string that contains
   your favorite paragraph of text - perhaps a poem, a speech, instructions
   to bake a cake, some inspirational verses, etc.

   Write a function that counts the number of alphabetic characters (a through z, or A through Z) in your text and then keeps track of how many are the letter 'e'.  Your function should print an analysis of the text like this::

       Your text contains 243 alphabetic characters, of which 109 (44.8%) are 'e'.
