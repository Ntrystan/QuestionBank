   The following code assumes that a procedure square has been defined that takes a size.  The code should create a turtle and then use it to draw a square, move forward, and draw a second square as shown at left, <img src="../_static/SquareForwardSquare.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"/> but the lines are mixed up.  Drag the lines into the correct order on the right.
