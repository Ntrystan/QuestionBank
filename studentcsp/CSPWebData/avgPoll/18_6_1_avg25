   The following program prints the maximum PM 2.5 pollution found, but the code is mixed up.  Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.  Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or have the wrong indention.
   -----
   # read all the lines
   inFile = open("uspoll.txt","r")
   lines = inFile.readlines()
   inFile.close()

   # initialize the variables
   total25 = 0
   count = 1.0
   =====
   # loop through the lines
   for line in lines:
   =====
       # split at :
       values = line.split(":")
   =====
       # get the PM 2.5 pollution
       new25 = float(values[2])
   =====
       # add to the total and count
       total25 = total25 + new25
       count = count + 1
   =====
   # print the average PM 2.5 value
   print("Average PM 2.5 value is ",total25/count)
