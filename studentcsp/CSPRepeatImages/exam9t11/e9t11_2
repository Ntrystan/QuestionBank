   :answer_a: X = 5 and Y = 72
   :answer_b: X = 36 and Y = 10
   :answer_c: X = 10 and Y = 36
   :answer_d: X = 12 and Y = 30
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if you were trying to draw a 5 sided figure.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if you were trying to draw a 36 sided figure.
   :feedback_c: The value of X is 10 to make a 10 sided figure and the amount to turn is 360 / 10 = 36.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if you were trying to draw a 12 sided figure.

   If we would like to draw a decagon (10 sided figure), what should the values of X and Y be in the code below?

      from turtle import *       # use the turtle library
      space = Screen()           # create a turtle space
      zoe = Turtle()             # create a turtle named zoe
      zoe.setheading(90)         # point due north
      for sides in range(X):     # repeat the indented lines X times
          zoe.forward(50)        # move forward by 50 units
          zoe.right(Y)           # And turn each one by Y
