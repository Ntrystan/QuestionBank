   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This stamps 5 turtles on a circle with a radius of 25.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the line zoe.penup() was removed.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was range(10) and right(36)
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was range(10) and right(36) and if the line zoe.penup() was removed.

   What would the following draw?

   ::

      from turtle import *
      space = Screen()
      zoe = Turtle()
      zoe.shape("turtle")
      zoe.penup()
      for size in range(5):
          zoe.forward(50)
          zoe.stamp()
          zoe.forward(-50)
          zoe.right(72)
