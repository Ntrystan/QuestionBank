   :answer_a: I. and II. only
   :answer_b: I. and III. only
   :answer_c: I. and IV. only
   :answer_d: III. and IV. only
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. temp == 0 will cause the temperature to increment to 1 when temp == 0 and temp greater than 0 will cause the temperature to only increment above temp == 0.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. temp == 0 will cause the temperature to increment to 1 when temp == 0
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. temp == 0 will cause the temperature to increment to 1 when temp == 0
   :feedback_d: Correct. These two conditionals will not allow temp to go above 0

   In a freezer, the temperature can be increased, but should not go above 0° C.  It can, however, be exactly equal to 0° C. The unfinished code for increasing the temperature in a freezer is shown below.  The variable temp represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius.
   ::

    PROCEDURE incrementTemperature(temp)
    {
       IF (<MISSING CODE>)
       {
          temp ← temp + 1
       }
       RETURN temp
    }

   Which of the following conditional statements will allow the code to function as expected?
   ::

    I.     temp == 0
    II.    temp > 0
    III.   temp < 0
    IV.    NOT (temp >= 0)
