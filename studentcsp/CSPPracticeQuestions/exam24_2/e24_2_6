   :answer_a: The output of the circuit is always true
   :answer_b: The output of the circuit is the same as the value of input A
   :answer_c: The output of the circuit is the same as the value of input B
   :answer_d: The output of the circuit is always false
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. If A is false, then the output is false in this circuit.
   :feedback_b: Correct. If either A or B is false, then the second input to Or is false, thus the final output is dependent on the value of A.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. In all cases, the output depends on the value of A instead of the value of B
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. If A is true, the circuit will always output true for a given B.
