   :answer_b: a ≥ c and b ≥ c

   :answer_d: c ≥ b and c ≥ a
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct. Plug-in values for 'a', 'b' and 'c', then trace the code!
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. The second part of this answer choice is incorrect since we display 'c' even though 'b ≥ c'.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. The first part of this answer choice is incorrect since we display 'a' even though 'c ≥ a'.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Both parts of this answer choice are incorrect, plug-in values for 'a', 'b' and 'c' to see for yourself.

   Consider the following incomplete pseudo-code to print the largest of three integer variables, namely ``a``, ``b`` and ``c``:
   ::

     IF (a ≥ b)
     {
        IF (<MISSING CODE 1>)
        {
           DISPLAY(a)
        }
        ELSE
        {
           DISPLAY(c)
        }
     }
     ELSE
     {
        IF (<MISSING CODE 2>)
        {
           DISPLAY(c)
        }
        ELSE
        {
           DISPLAY(b)
        }
     }

   Which of the following options can be substituted for <MISSING CODE 1> and <MISSING CODE 2>, respectively, for the code to work as intended?
