   :feedback_a: Incorrect. The robot has a direct path from origin to destination. Therefore it will reach the gray square in this case.
   :feedback_b: Correct. Let's look at what happens when the robot reaches the sqaure (4, 2), that is, 4th row from top and the 2nd column from left. The robot is facing right and has just moved forward from square (4, 1). Next we check if the robot can move left, since it can the robot turns left and faces the top. Then we check if the robot can move right, since it can, the robot turns right and faces the right side again. Then, 'goalReached()' evaluates to false, the next iteration beigns and the robot moves forward onto square (4, 3). At this point, we can conclude that the robot will never reach the gray sqaure since it has gone off-track, in fact, the robot will continue to move until it gets stuck at sqaure (3, 4).
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Let's look at what happens when the robot reaches the sqaure (2, 2), that is, 2nd row from top and the 2nd column from left. The robot is facing the top and has just moved forward from square (3, 2). Next we check if the robot can move left, since it cannot the robot's direction remains unchanged. Then we check if the robot can move right, since it can, the robot turns right and faces the right side. Then, 'goalReached()' evaluates to false, the next iteration beigns and the robot moves forward onto square (2, 3). At this point, we can conclude that the robot will reach the gray sqaure since a direct path lies ahead.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. The robot has a direct path from origin to destination. Therefore it will reach the gray square in this case.

   The code segment below moves a robot through a maze, with the objective of reaching the gray square. The robot in each grid is represented as a red triangle and is initially facing upwards. The robot can move onto white and gray squares, but not onto the black squares. The procedure ``goalReached()`` used in the code segment below evaluates to ``true`` if the robot is on the gray square and evaluates to ``false`` in all other cases.
   ::

    REPEAT UNTIL (goalReached ())
    {
        IF (CAN_MOVE (forward))
        {
            MOVE_FORWARD ()
        }
        IF (CAN_MOVE (left))
        {
            ROTATE_LEFT ()
        }
        IF (CAN_MOVE (right))
        {
            ROTATE_RIGHT ()
        }
    }

   For which of the following grids does the program NOT correctly move the triangle to the gray square?
