   :answer_a: An unsolvable problem cannot be solved using any algorithm.
   :answer_b: A solvable problem can be solved using an algorithm.
   :answer_c: Some solvable problems will not run in reasonable time.
   :answer_d: An unsolvable problem can be solved using an algorithm.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. If a problem is unsolvable, not even an algorithm can solve it.
   :feedback_b: Correct. An algorithm can solve an a solvable problem.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Some solvable problems will take long to solve with an algorithm and will, therefore, not run in reasonable time.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. If a problem is unsolvable, an algorithm will not solve it.
