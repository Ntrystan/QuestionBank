   :answer_a: Problems that have a “yes” or “no” answer for all inputs are called decidable.
   :answer_b: Problems that have a “yes” or “no” answer for all inputs are called undecidable.
   :answer_c: Undecidable problems always have a solution.
   :answer_d: Problems that cannot be solved with an algorithm are called solvable.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct. A decidable problem is solvable.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. If a problem is solvable, it cannot be undecidable.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. It is impossible to construct an algorithm that solves an undecidable problem.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Problems than cannot be solved with an algorithm are called unsolvable.
