   :feedback_a: Correct. This is a repeating decimal which will result in an overflow error.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Though the solution is undefined, it will not result in an overflow error.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. This will not result in an overflow error but rather a value error.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. This will result in an infinite loop.

   Which of the following is most likely an example of an overflow error?

   ::


     (A)

     z ← ⅓


     (B)

     z ← 1/0


     (C)

     nums ← (1, 2, 3)

     n ← 0

     REPEAT 4 TIMES

     n ← n + 1

     DISPLAY(nums(n))


     (D)

     n ← 0

     REPEAT UNTIL NOT n = 0

     n ← n * 100
