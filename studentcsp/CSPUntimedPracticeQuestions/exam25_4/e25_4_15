   :feedback_a: Incorrect. The value of n increases every time this code repeats.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. The block of code will repeat 3 times and the value of n will be 16. If it repeats a fourth time, n would equal 32.
   :feedback_c: Correct. The block of code will repeat 3 times and the value of n will be 16.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. The value of n equals 4 after repeating one time, but the block of code will repeat until i = 4.

   What is the value of n after the above code executes?

   ::


     i ← 1

     n ← 2

     REPEAT until i = 4

       {
       n ← n * 2

       i ← i + 1
       }
