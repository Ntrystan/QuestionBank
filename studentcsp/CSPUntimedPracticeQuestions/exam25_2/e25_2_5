   :answer_a: "Where are you going with that?"
   :answer_b: Nothing
   :answer_c: "?"
   :answer_d: "?Where are you going with that?"
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. We are adding onto the existing value of newS which is "?", so newS will begin with a "?".
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. newS has a value, therefore something will display.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. "? is the initial value of the variable newS".
   :feedback_d: Correct. The code iterates through the string phrase and adds each character in the string to the variable newS which is initially "?".

   What will the following code print?

   newS ← “?”

   phrase ← ”Where are you going with that?”

   for EACH item in phrase:

    { newS ← newS + item }

   DISPLAY(newS)
