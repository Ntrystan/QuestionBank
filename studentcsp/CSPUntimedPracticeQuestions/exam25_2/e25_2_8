  :answer_a: (num1 = num2)
  :answer_b: (num1 = num2) OR (num1 â‰  num2)
  :answer_c: (num1 = num2) AND (num1<0)
  :answer_d: (num1 = num2) AND (num2>0)
  :correct: d
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. The two variables can be equal to each other and still be negative integers.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Regardless of whether the two variables are equal or not equal to one another, they can still be negative.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The two variables would both be negative in this case.
  :feedback_d: Correct. If num1 is equal to num2 and num2 is greater than 0, then both values must be positive.

  Given two variables, num1 and num2, which of the following would mean that both num1 and num2 are positive integers?
