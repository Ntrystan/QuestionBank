  :answer_a: “I am a sophomore.”
  :answer_b: "I am not a freshman"
  :answer_c: "Who knows what I am?"
  :answer_d: It is impossible to tell with the given information.
  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: Incorrect.  Sophomore is False, so this would not be displayed.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect.  Freshman is False, so this would not be displayed.
  :feedback_c: Correct. Since we know that freshman is and sophomore are False, the ELSE block after sophomore is executed.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Since we know that freshman is and sophomore are False, the ELSE block after sophomore is executed.

  Consider the code below.

  IF(freshman)

   { DISPLAY(“I am a freshman.”) }

  ELSE

   IF(sophomore)

    { DISPLAY(“I am a sophomore”) }

   ELSE

    { DISPLAY(“Who knows what I am?”) }

  If variables freshman and sophomore are false, what is displayed?
