   :answer_a: “You ordered -2 items”
   :answer_b: “You ordered 1 item”
   :answer_c: Nothing will be printed.
   :answer_d: You will get an error message.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. There is no code to make "You ordered -2 items" the value of 'message.'
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. This would be the value of 'message' if numItems equaled 1.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Variable 'message' was never assigned a value, so this would result in an error and the code would not run completely.
   :feedback_d: Correct. Variable 'message' was never assigned a value, so this would result in an error.

   Refer to the following code:

   ::

     numItems ← 1
     IF numItems ← 1
     { message ← "You ordered 1 item” }
     IF numItems > 1
     { message ← "You ordered " + numItems + " items" }
     DISPLAY(message)


   What will print if numItems ← -2?
