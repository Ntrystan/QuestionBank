   :answer_a: Executing code once
   :answer_b: Repeating a block of code until a condition is met
   :answer_c: Duplicating a section of code multiple times in a program
   :answer_d: Debugging code multiple times until it passes testing
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Iteration with a loop involves repetition, so executing code once is not iteration.
   :feedback_b: Correct. Iteration repeats one or more statements until a condition is met.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Iterating with loops is a way of preventing you from having to duplicate a section of code multiple times.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Debugging involves a person finding errors or "bugs" in their code. Iteration with loops runs a set of code until a condition is met.

   What does iteration with computer science loops mean?
