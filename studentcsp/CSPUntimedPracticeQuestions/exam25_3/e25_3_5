   :feedback_a: Correct. The loop iterates through the three integers in 'numbers' and displays the proper strings when the IF statements are true.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. 'Positive' is displayed for the final item in the list, but there are two other items in the list.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. This does not account for the 0 in the list.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. The if and else clauses are satisfied in this code, so there would be an output.

   Refer to the following code:

   ::

     numbers ← [-1,0,1]
     FOR EACH item IN numbers:
     IF item > 0:
       DISPLAY("positive")
     ELIF item < 0:
       DISPLAY(“negative”)
     ELSE:
       DISPLAY(“neither”)

   What will print when this code is run?
