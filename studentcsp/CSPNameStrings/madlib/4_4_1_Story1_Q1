   :answer_a: realEnding = firstName + " called the police who took the witch away."
   :answer_b: print(firstName + " called the police who took the witch away.")
   :answer_c: print("Pat called the police who took the witch away.")
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would only work if you also put <code>print(realEnding)</code> after this line.
   :feedback_b: This is a good way to do this since the line that is printed will have the correct first name.  You could also make a string named <code>realEnding</code> first, and then print it.
   :feedback_c: This <i>would</i> work.  But if you changed the <code>firstName</code> variable, this line would not change.  A different answer is better.

   Now you want to add more to the story. You want it to say: "Pat called the police who took the witch away."  Adding which of these lines to the end of the program will make that happen?  (Hint: It is okay to *try* each one!)
