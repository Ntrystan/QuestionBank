  :answer_a: No error, since we compute it inside the loop.
  :answer_b: We would get an error.
  :answer_c: We need the one before the while loop, but not the one afterward.
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: We have to compute it before, or abs(target-guessSquared) > 0.01 would be an error.
  :feedback_b: A variable has to be declared (created) before it is used.
  :feedback_c: We need both.  The one before sets up the test.  The one inside the loop lets us update guessSquared.

   What would happen if we didn't compute ``guessSquared`` before the ``while`` loop?
