  :answer_a: Just once.
  :answer_b: Twice.
  :answer_c: Three times.
  :answer_d: Four times
  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: The first time we do the test, guess is 2, and 2 * 2 is 4, and 6 - 4 is 2 which is greater than 0.01.
  :feedback_b: The second time we do the test, guess is 2.5 (average of 3 and 2). But, 2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25 which is still more than 0.01 away from 6.
  :feedback_c: The third time we do the test, guess is 2.45 which is 6.0025 when squared.  This is less than 0.01 away from 6.  So test executes 3 times.
  :feedback_d: We don't get to a fourth time.  Guess is 2, then 2.5, then 2.45 at which point the test fails and and the loop stops.

   How many times do we execute the test ``abs(target-guessSquared) > 0.01`` when ``target = 6`` (in the video)?
