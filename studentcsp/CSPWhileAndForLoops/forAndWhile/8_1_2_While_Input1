                  :feedback_a: All the statements that are indented 4 spaces to the right of the <code>while</code> are part of the body of the loop.
                  :feedback_b: There are four statements that are indented 4 spaces to the right of the <code>while</code> statement, so there are four statements in the body of this loop.
                  :feedback_c: Is the <code>print(message)</code> line indented 4 spaces to the right of the <code>while</code>? If not it is not part of the body of the loop.
                  :feedback_d: While line 11 is indented this is just to allow the print statement to take up more than one line.  The print statement is not indented so the body of the loop contains just 4 lines.

                  How many lines are in the body of the ``while`` loop in while_input above?
