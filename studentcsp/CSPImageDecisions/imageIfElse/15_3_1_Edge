   :feedback_a: Black and white are colors.
   :feedback_b: This image will only have black or white pixels in all columns except the rightmost one.  The pixel colors in the rightmost column will not be changed.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if we were only using shades of gray, but we are only using two colors.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we were using all color values, but we are only using black and white.

   How many different colors will be in our image (except the last column) when we are done?
