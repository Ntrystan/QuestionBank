   :feedback_a: It will have to test if <code>num</code> is equal to 1 and because that is false it will test if <code>num</code> is equal to 2.
   :feedback_b: With the <code>elif</code> it won't execute the other <code>elif</code>'s if one of them is true.
   :feedback_c: With <code>elif</code> it will test each until one of the conditions is true and then skip the rest.
   :feedback_d: There are only 5 logical expression here so it can't be more than 5.
