   :feedback_a: This would be true if the 2nd - 4th if were elif instead.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the score was 83 and the 2nd - 4th if were elif instead.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the score was 73 and the 2nd - 4th if were elif instead.
   :feedback_d: Since it is true that 93 is greater than 60 this will set grade to "D"
   :feedback_e: This would be true if score was less than 60.

   What is the value of grade when the following code executes and score is 93?

   ::

      if score >= 90:
          grade = "A"
      if score >= 80:
          grade = "B"
      if score >= 70:
          grade = "C"
      if score >= 60:
          grade = "D"
      else
          grade = "E"
