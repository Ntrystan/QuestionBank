   :correct: a,b
   :answer_a: Start with numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
   :answer_b: Change the range to range(1,len(numbers),2)
   :answer_c: Change the range to range(0,len(numbers),1)
   :answer_d: Change the range to range(0,len(numbers),3)
   :feedback_a: Yes, that would work, but there's an easier way
   :feedback_b: Yes, just by starting at 1, then skipping 2 each time, we'd collect the odds
   :feedback_c: No, that would collect all the numbers in evens
   :feedback_d: No, that would result in 0,3,6,9 in evens

   Which of these changes to the program would give you just the odd values in a list? (Again: Try it!)  Select all that work.
