                   :answer_a: var1 is 45, var2 is 45
                   :answer_b: var1 is 45, var2 is var1
                   :answer_c: var1 is 17.3, var2 is 45
                   :answer_d: var1 is 17.3, var2 is 17.3
                   :correct: d
                   :feedback_a: The variable var1 was set to 45, but that gets changed in line 2, before var2 gets set to any value at all.
                   :feedback_b: Both variables contain numeric values, because those are the only values in this program.
                   :feedback_c: The variable var2 never gets set to 45 in this program.
                   :feedback_d: The variable var1 is first set to 45 and then changed to 17.3, and then, var2 gets the value from var1.

                   What are the values in ``var1`` and ``var2`` after this program runs?
