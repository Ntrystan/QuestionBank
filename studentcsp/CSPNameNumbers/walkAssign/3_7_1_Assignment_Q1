   :answer_a: 1
   :answer_b: 12.3
   :answer_c: "b"
   :answer_d: "d"
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: The variable a is not used in defining the variable b.
   :feedback_b: The variable d is set to a copy of the value in variable b.  The variable b still holds the value 12.3 as well.
   :feedback_c: The variable d gets assigned the same value as the one stored in b.
   :feedback_d: The variable d gets its value from the variable b.

   What is the value of variable ``d`` when this program is finished running?
