                   :feedback_a: The values will actually be computed and numbers will be printed.
                   :feedback_b: The variable names will not be printed.
                   :feedback_c: The first print will print the value of daysInWeek (7), the second the value of numDays (21), and the third the value of numDays2 (21).
                   :feedback_d: The value for daysInWeek will be computed and assigned.

                   What three values are printed when this program runs?
