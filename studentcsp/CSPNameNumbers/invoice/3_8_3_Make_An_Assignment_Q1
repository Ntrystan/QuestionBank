  :answer_a: totalCost = apples + pears
  :answer_b: totalCost = (0.4 * apples) + (0.65 * pears)
  :answer_c: totalCost = (0.4 * pears) + (0.65 * apples)
  :answer_d: totalCost = (0.4 + apples) * (0.65 + pears)
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: That does not consider the cost of the apples or pears.
  :feedback_b: We need to multiply the cost per apple times the number of apples and add it to the cost per pear times the number of pears.
  :feedback_c: That gets the costs backwards
  :feedback_d: That is the wrong formula for computing total cost.

   Which line of code will compute the correct ``totalCost`` if put into line 3 above?
