   The following program uses the stamp method to create a line of turtle shapes as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/Turtle3Stamp.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" /> but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, set the shape to "turtle", and pick up the pen.  Then the turtle should repeat the following three times: go forward 50 pixels and leave a copy of the turtle at the current position.  <br /><br /><p>Drag the needed blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order with the correct indention.  Click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or are the wrong blocks.</p>
