   :feedback_a: Notice that each of the first 4 statements start with an if.  What is the value of grade when it is printed?
   :feedback_b: Each of the first 4 if statements will execute.
   :feedback_c: Copy this code to an activecode window and run it.
   :feedback_d: Each of the first 4 if statements will be executed. So grade will be set to A, then B then C and finally D.
   :feedback_e: This will only be true when score is less than 60.

   What is printed when the following code executes?

   ::

     score = 93
     if score >= 90:
         grade = "A"
     if score >= 80:
         grade = "B"
     if score >= 70:
         grade = "C"
     if score >= 60:
         grade = "D"
     if score < 60:
         grade = "E"
     print(grade)
