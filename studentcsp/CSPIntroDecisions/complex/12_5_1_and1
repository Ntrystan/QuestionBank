  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: This would be true if the second expression was x <= 10.
  :feedback_b: This would be true if the first logical expression was x >= 0.
  :feedback_c: The "condition true" will only be printed when x is greater than 0 and less than 10 so this is the range from 1 to 9.

   Given the code below, what describes the values of x that will cause the code to print "condition true"?

   ::

     if x > 0 and x < 10:
         print ("condition true")
     print ("All done")
