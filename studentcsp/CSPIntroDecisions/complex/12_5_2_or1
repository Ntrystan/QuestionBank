  :feedback_a: This will be true if x is greater than 0 or less than 10.  This covers all possible values of x.
  :feedback_b: This would be true if the logical expressions were joined with and instead of or.
  :feedback_c: This would be true if the logical expressions were jointed with and instead of or and if the first logical expression was x >= 0.

   Given the code below, what describes the values of x that will cause the code to print "condition true"?

   ::

     if x > 0 or x < 10:
         print ("condition true")
     print ("All done")
