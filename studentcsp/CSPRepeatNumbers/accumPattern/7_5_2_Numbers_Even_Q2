   :answer_a: Because if we started with 1, we would get all odd numbers
   :answer_b: Because all lists start with zero
   :answer_c: Because we end with 101
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This gives us [0,2,4,6...98,100].
   :feedback_b: They don't have to start at 0.
   :feedback_c: That is true, but is not relevant here.

   Why do we START with zero?
