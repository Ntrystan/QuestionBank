   :answer_a: A left leaf reduces the balance factor by 1
   :answer_b: A right leaf reduces the balance factor by 2
   :answer_c: A left leaf increases the balance factor by 1 and the right leaf reduces the balance factor by 1 and does not affect the grandparent's balance factor
   :answer_d: A left leaf increases the balance factor by 1 and the right leaf reduces the balance factor by 1 of the parent
   :answer_e: The leaves do not affect the parentâ€™s balance factor, only the ancestor nodes
