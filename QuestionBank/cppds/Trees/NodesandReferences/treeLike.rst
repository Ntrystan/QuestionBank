   :feedback_a: Incorrect, a hash table maps key, value pairs for quick access. To access an item in our tree, we have to go through everything before it.
   :feedback_b: Correct, this tree is essentially a linked list connecting other linked lists
   :feedback_c: Incorrect, a queue is good for putting data in to fit a FIFO sequence
   :feedback_d: Incorrect, a stack is good for putting data in to fit a LIFO sequence
