    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: No. In an example like this you want to count the nested loops, especially the loops that are dependent on the same variable, in this case, n.
    :feedback_b: Right! A nested loop like this is O(n<sup>2</sup>).
    :feedback_c: No. log n typically is indicated when the problem is iteratively made smaller
    :feedback_d: No. In an example like this you want to count the nested loops. especially the loops that are dependent on the same variable, in this case, n.

    Given the following code fragment, what is its Big-O running time?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      int main(){
          int test = 0;
          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
              for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                  test = test + i * j;
              }
          }
          return 0;
      }
