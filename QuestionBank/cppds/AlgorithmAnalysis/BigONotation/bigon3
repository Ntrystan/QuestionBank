    The Big O of a particular algorithm is :math:`O(n^{3})`. Given that it takes 2 seconds to complete the algorithm with 1000 inputs;
    how long would it take with 2000 inputs?
    ``|blank|`` seconds.
    
    10,000?
    ``|blank|`` seconds.
    
    -   :16: Correct!
        :6 9: Incorrect. Try higher. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
        :23 6: Incorrect. Try lower. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
    -   :2000: Correct!
        :1500 499: Incorrect. Try higher. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
        :2500 499: Incorrect. Try lower. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
