    :answer_a: Algorithm 1 will require a greater number of steps to complete than Algorithm 2
    :answer_b: Algorithm 2 will require a greater number of steps to complete than Algorithm 1
    :answer_c: Algorithm 1 will require a greater number of steps to complete than Algorithm 2 until they reach the crossover point
    :answer_d: Algorithm 1 and 2 will always require the same number of steps to complete
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: This could be true depending on the input, but consider the broader picture
    :feedback_b: This could be true depending on the input, but consider the broader picture
    :feedback_c: Correct!
    :feedback_d: No, the efficiency of both will depend on the input
