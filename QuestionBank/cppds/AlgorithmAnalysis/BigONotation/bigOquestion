    The Big O of a particular algorithm is :math:`O(n^{2})`. Given that it takes 2 seconds to complete the algorithm with 1 million inputs;
    
    how long would it take with 2 million inputs? ``|blank|`` seconds.
    
    10 million? ``|blank|``
    
    -   :8: Correct!
        :2: Incorrect. Remember, think about what it means for the n to be squared.
    -   :200: Correct!
        :x: Incorrect. Remember, think about what it means for the n to be squared.
