    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Incorrect. Try again. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
    :feedback_b: Incorrect. Try again. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
    :feedback_c: Correct!
    :feedback_d:  Incorrect. Try again. Think about what happens to the time as more operations occur.
    :feedback_e: No, only one of them is correct. Try again.

    The Big O of a particular algorithm is :math:`O(n^{3})`.
    Given that it takes 2 seconds to complete the algorithm with 1000 inputs;
    how long would it take with 2000 inputs?
