  :answer_a: the space it takes
  :answer_b: the time it takes
  :answer_c: the number of steps
  :answer_d: the readability of the code
  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: This can be dependent of the programming language
  :feedback_b: This can be dependent on the machine, programming language, and other factors
  :feedback_c: Yes, when quantifying the time it takes to execute an algorithm we base it on the number of steps it takes to solve the problem, not the time it takes
  :feedback_d: No, a very efficient algorithm can be programmed efficiently in C++ without any extra spaces making it unreadable, however the solution would still be efficient.

  When considering the Big O of an algorithm, what do we use to quantify our description of an algorithm.
