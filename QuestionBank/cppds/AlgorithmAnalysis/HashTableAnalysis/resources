   :feedback_a: No, we do not consider the restraints of a language when thinking about how efficient an algorithm is.
   :feedback_b: Yes, we consider how much space we need to solve a problem.
   :feedback_c: Yes, we consider how much time it takes to solve a problem
   :feedback_d: No, we do not consider how much energy it takes at this point.

   When considering computer resources, what factors do we have in mind? Select all that apply.
