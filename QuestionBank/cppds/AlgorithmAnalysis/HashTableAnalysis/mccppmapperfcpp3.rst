    :answer_a: Popping the first index from a vector.
    :answer_b: Popping an element from the end of a vector.
    :answer_c: Adding a new element to a vector.
    :answer_d: vector[10]
    :answer_e: all of the above are O(1)
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: When you remove the first element of a vector, all the other elements of the vector must be shifted forward.
    :feedback_b: Removing an element from the end of the vector is a constant operation.
    :feedback_c: Adding to the end of a vector is a constant operation
    :feedback_d: Indexing a vector is a constant operation
    :feedback_e: There is one operation that requires all other vector elements to be moved.
