    :answer_e: None of the above.
    :correct: d
    :feedback_a: No. Use i = 1, i = 2, and i = 3, plugging into i^3.
    :feedback_b: No. Use i = 1, i = 2, and i = 3, plugging into i^3.
    :feedback_c: No. Use i = 1, i = 2, and i = 3, plugging into i^3.
    :feedback_d: Right! It is 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27.
    :feedback_e: One of the above is correct!
