    If you change the tower height in Line 17 from 3 to 6, how many moves must you make to complete the Hanoi tower? (hint, try implementing a counter to return the correct number)
    
    - :63: Correct, you can make a global counter at line 3, and then cout the increasing total under line 11.
      :62: Technically you are correct but, you are off by one.
      :.*: Please try again you need to add a statement at line 3, and under line 11.
