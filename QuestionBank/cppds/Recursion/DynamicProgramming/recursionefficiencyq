   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: False
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! Sometimes simple problems only need simple solutions, like a loop
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Recursion is not always the ideal solution.

    Sometimes recursion can be more computationally expensive than an alternative, True or False?
