   :answer_a: It must progress from the base case
   :answer_b: It must move towards the base case
   :answer_c: It must have a base case
   :answer_d: It must call itself
   :correct: b,c,d
   :feedback_a: If it starts at the base case, then when would it stop?
   :feedback_b: Correct. The base case is your endpoint.
   :feedback_c: Correct. The base case is essential if you want a stopping point
   :feedback_d: Correct. If it doesn't call itself then it won't repeat
