    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: You are correct! K is a small constant, and N is the total number of vertices (or spaces on a chessboard).
    :feedback_b: No, the Knight's Tour is not linear.
    :feedback_c: No, the Knight's Tour does not have a nested loop that iterates through all values twice.
    :feedback_d: No, the input is not processed in a fashion indicative of a factorial.
