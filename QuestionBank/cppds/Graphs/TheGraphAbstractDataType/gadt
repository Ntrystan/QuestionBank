    :match_2: addVertex(vert)|||adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.
    :match_3: addEdge(fromVert, toVert)|||Adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
    :match_4: addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight)|||Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
    :match_5: getVertex(vertKey)|||finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.
    :match_6: getVertices()|||returns the list of all vertices in the graph.
