    :answer_b: {E, C, B, A, D}
    :answer_c: {E, C, B, D, A}
    :answer_d: Both B and C
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: Not quite, remember, this is a is a greedy algorithm, so it will try to choose the cheapest next step.
    :feedback_b: Correct!
    :feedback_c: Not quite, try again!
    :feedback_d: No, there is only one correct answer!

    Beginning at node E, how will Prim's algorithm span across the graph?
