   :feedback_a: The three numbers used in selecting the pivot are 1, 9, 19.  1 is not the median, and would be a very bad choice for the pivot since it is the smallest number in the list.
   :feedback_b:  Good job.
   :feedback_c: although 16 would be the median of 1, 16, 19 the middle is at len(list) // 2.
   :feedback_d: the three numbers used in selecting the pivot are 1, 9, 19.  9 is the median.  19 would be a bad choice since it is almost the largest.

   Given the following list of numbers [1, 20, 11, 5, 2, 9, 16, 14, 13, 19] what would be the first pivot value using the median of 3 method?
