  :feedback_a: It's important to remember that quicksort works on the entire list and sorts it in place.
  :feedback_b: Remember quicksort works on the entire list and sorts it in place.
  :feedback_c: The first partitioning works on the entire list, and the second partitioning works on the left partition not the right.
  :feedback_d: The first partitioning works on the entire list, and the second partitioning works on the left partition.

  Given the following list of numbers [14, 17, 13, 15, 19, 10, 3, 16, 9, 12] which answer shows the contents of the list after the second partitioning according to the quicksort algorithm?
