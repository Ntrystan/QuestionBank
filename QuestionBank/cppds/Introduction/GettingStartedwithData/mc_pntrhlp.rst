   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Not quite, the variable varN no longer equals 100 past line 7!
   :feedback_b: Right!
   :feedback_c: No, the values do not add together!
   :feedback_d: We are dereferencing the pointer, so you would not get the address of varN. Try again!
   :feedback_e: One of the above is indeed correct.
