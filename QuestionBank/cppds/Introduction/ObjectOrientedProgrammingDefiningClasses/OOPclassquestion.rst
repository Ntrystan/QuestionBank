    :answer_c: Polymorphism
    :answer_d: Abstraction
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: Correct! Airplane inherits many things from Vehicle
    :feedback_b: Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the contents of a class except when absolutely necessary. Wings is not hidden from Vehicle, it simply does not exist in the Vehicle class.
    :feedback_c: Polymorphism is the ability to process objects or methods differently depending on their data type, class, number of arguments, etc. A subclass using parts of a pre-existing class is not an example of polymorphism because they are used in the same way.
    :feedback_d: Abstraction is the principle of focusing on desired behaviors and properties while disregarding what is irrelevant/unimportant. Take another look at what the two classes have in common.
