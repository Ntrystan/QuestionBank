  :answer_a: Vectors can change size.
  :answer_b: Vectors offer many more features and protections than arrays.
  :answer_c: Vectors don't use contiguous memory, so elements can be inserted.
  :answer_d: more than one of the above
  :answer_e: none of the above
  :correct: d
  :feedback_a: Yes, however, there are more benefits to using vectors.
  :feedback_b: Not all of the protections of arrays are offered by vectors; one can still iterate off of either end.
  :feedback_c: No. Although elements can be inserted in vectors, they do require contiguous memory.
  :feedback_d: Right! Good job!
  :feedback_e: One of the above is indeed correct.
