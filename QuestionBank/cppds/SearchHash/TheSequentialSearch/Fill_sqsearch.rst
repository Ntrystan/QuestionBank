    For the following unordered sequential list: {0, 1, 2, 13, 8, 19, 17, 32, 42}, searching for |blank| would produce the best case scenario, and searching for |blank| would produce the worst case scenario.
    
    - :0: Correct! 0 is at the beginning of the list wich would provide the best case of O(1)
      :.*: No! try again, only one value place in this list will produce the best case.
    
    - :42: Correct! 42 is at the end of the list wich would provide the worst case of O(n)
      :.*: No! try again, only one value in this list will produce the worst case.
