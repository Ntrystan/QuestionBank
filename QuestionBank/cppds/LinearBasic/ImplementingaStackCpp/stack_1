   :answer_c: 27
   :answer_d: The stack is empty
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Remember that a stack is built from the bottom up.
   :feedback_b: pay attention to the line that says m.pop();.
   :feedback_c: Good job. This is correct because the 12 was poped of from the end and the 27 was pushed.
   :feedback_d: This would mean everyting is removed from the stack, when does that happen?

    m.push(12);
    m.pop();
    m.push(27);
