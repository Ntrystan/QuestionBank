   :feedback_a: Remember the first item added to the queue is the first item removed. Remember FIFO.
   :feedback_b: Yes, first in first out means that the 10 is now gone.
   :feedback_c: Queues and stacks are both data structures where you can only access the first or the last items.
   :feedback_d: Oops, maybe you missed the pop call at the end?

   Suppose you have the following series of queue operations.

   ::

       queue<int> q;
       q.push(10);
       q.push(20);
       q.push(30);
       q.pop();

   What items are left on the queue?
