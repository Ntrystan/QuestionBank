  :answer_a: range(5, 25, 5)
  :answer_b: range(20, 3, -5)
  :answer_c: range(20, 5, 4)
  :answer_d: range(20, 5, -5)
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: The step 5 is positive, while the given sequence is decreasing.  This answer creates the reversed, increasing sequence.
  :feedback_b: Yes: If we take steps of -5, not worrying about the ending, we get 20, 25, 10, 5, 0, .... The limit 3 is past the 5, so the range sequence stops with the 5.
  :feedback_c: The step 5 is positive so the sequence would need to increase from 20 toward 4.  That does not make sense and the sequence would be empty.
  :feedback_d: the sequence can never include the second parameter (5).  The second parameter must always be past the end of the range sequence.

  Which range function call will produce the sequence 20, 15, 10, 5?
