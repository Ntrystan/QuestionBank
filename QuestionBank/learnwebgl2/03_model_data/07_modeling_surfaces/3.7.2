  :match_1: One normal vector|||Flat shading; one color for the entire face.
  :match_2: Three normal vectors, one per vertex|||Smooth shading; color varies across the face.
  :match_3: Multiple normal vectors across the face (i.e., bump map)|||Colors vary across the face to simulate roughness.

  Regarding surface normals, match the number of normal vectors with the assignment of face colors.
