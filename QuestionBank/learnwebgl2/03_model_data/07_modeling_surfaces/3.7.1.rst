  :answer_a: The properties of the surface.
  :answer_b: Properties of the light sources that are reflecting light off of the surface.
  :answer_c: The rendering mode used to draw the triangle (gl.TRIANGLES, gl.TRIANGLE_STRIP, etc.)
  :answer_d: How many triangles are in the entire model's triangular mesh.
  :correct: a,b
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Correct.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. How vertices are defined to specify a triangle has no impact on the triangle's surface.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Triangles are rendered one at a time, so the number of triangles does not matter.

  To accurately render the **surface** of a triangle, what to you need to know? (Select all that apply.)
