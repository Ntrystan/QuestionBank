  :answer_a: Reflected light.
  :answer_b: Refracted light.
  :answer_c: Absorbed light.
  :answer_d: Subsurface scattering of light.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. You see an object because light has reflected off of it and into your eyes.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Refracted light has passed through a transparent object, not an opaque object.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Absorbed light can't be seen. Its energy has warmed up the object.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Opaque objects have no subsurface scattering.

  For an opaque object, you see the object because of what type of light?
