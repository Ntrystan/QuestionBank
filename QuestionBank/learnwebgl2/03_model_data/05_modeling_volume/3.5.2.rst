  :answer_a: A triangle defined by 3 points where 2 or more of them are equal to each other.
  :answer_b: A triangle defined by 3 points where the 3 points lay along a straight line.
  :answer_c: A triangle defined by 3 unique points that do not lay along a straight line.
  :answer_d: A triangle defined by 3 points where the area inside its boundaries is positive.
  :correct: a,b
  :feedback_a: Correct. If 2 of the points are equal, you have a straight line. If all 3 points are equal, you have a single point.
  :feedback_b: Correct. The 3 points define a straight line, not a triangle.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This is a valid triangle definition.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. This is a valid triangle definition.
