  :answer_a: The approximation of the 3D object can be more accurate.
  :answer_b: The rendering will be slower -- because is has to draw more triangles.
  :answer_c: More memory will be required to store the 3D representation.
  :answer_d: The approximation of the 3D object will be less accurate.
  :correct: a,b,c
  :feedback_a: Correct. Assuming the added triangles add details to the object's form.
  :feedback_b: Correct.
  :feedback_c: Correct.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Though it would be possible to decrease accuracy if the added triangles were ill-placed.

  What are the implications of adding more triangles to a triangular mesh? (Select all that apply.)
