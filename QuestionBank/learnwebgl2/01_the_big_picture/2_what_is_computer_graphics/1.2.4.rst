    :answer_a: the rendering of a scene can be produced in less than 1/30th of a second.
    :answer_b: the resulting image contains the current time.
    :answer_c: the rendering of a scene happens right now.
    :answer_d: the rendering is really fast.
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: Correct. Displaying 30 frames per second allows most people to perceive motion without flicker.
    :feedback_b: No, that's silly!
    :feedback_c: Maybe, but the important issue is whether 30 or more images per second can be created.
    :feedback_d: No, fast rendering does not guarantee motion without flicker, the number of frames per second does.
