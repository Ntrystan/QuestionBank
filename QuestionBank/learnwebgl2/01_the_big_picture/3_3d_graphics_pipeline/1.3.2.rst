    Please correctly order the following steps to the graphics pipeline.
    -----
    Setup geometric and scene data for the pipeline.
    Execute a vertex shader on each vertex of a geometric model.
    Clip away everything that is not in the camera's field-of-view.
    Map the 3D object coordinates into pixel coordinates of a raster image.
    Determine which specific pixels represent a geometric primitive.
    Execute a fragment shader on each pixel that represents a geometric primitive.
    Combine pixel colors.
    Output a raster image.
