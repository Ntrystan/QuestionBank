    :answer_a: Global variables can be accidentally redefined, which can make errors very difficult to track down.
    :answer_b: If you pick a variable name that JavaScript is already using for some other data, you might be modifying JavaScript in ways you don't understand.
    :answer_c: Global variables can't be changed easily.
    :answer_d: Your global variables might be changed by the browser.
    :correct: a,b
    :feedback_a: Correct, especially when JavaScript already has many, many global variables.
    :feedback_b: Correct. There are so many JavaScript global variables, you could easily pick a name that is already in use for something else.
    :feedback_c: Incorrect. Global variables nca be changed anywhere in a program.
    :feedback_d: Incorrect. The browser doesn't know about your global variables.

    Object-oriented programming encapsulates a group of related data values and
    functionality that can manipulate that data. In so doing, many variables that
    would otherwise be global variables are contained inside a single object instance.
    This reduces the number of global variables in a program. Why is this so important?  (Select all that apply.)
