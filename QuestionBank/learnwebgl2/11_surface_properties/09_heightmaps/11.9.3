  What conditions might cause a triangle to flip its orientation when
  a *displacement map* is used?

  - the underlying mesh caves inward.

    + Correct. When the vertices are projected to a new location their
      relative position to each other can cause the counter-clockwise
      ordering of the vertices to flip. This is only important if the
      vertex ordering is used in the *fragment shader*.

  - the underlying mesh bulges outward.

    - Incorrect.

  - the underlying mesh has too few vertices.

    - Incorrect.

  - the underlying mesh has too many vertices.

    - Incorrect.
