  The "*normal vector*" assigned to a vertex to implement "smooth shading"
  is typically calculated by ...

  - taking the average of the face *normal vectors* of every triangle that uses the vertex.

    + Correct.

  - using the *normal vector* of the largest triangle that uses the vertex.

    - Incorrect.

  - summing all of the *normal vectors* around it.

    - Incorrect. It sums the *normal vectors* and divides by how many were added together.

  - multiplying adjacent *normal vectors*.

    - Incorrect.
