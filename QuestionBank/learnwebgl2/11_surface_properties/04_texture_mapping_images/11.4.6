  Please correctly order the following steps needed to implement image texture mapping
  in a WebGL program.
  -----
  Download a model from the server. (The model must have texture <br>coordinates defined for each vertex.)
  Download the image used for texture mapping from the server.
  Create a "texture object" in the GPU that contains the image.
  Before rendering, attach the "texture object" to a GPU "texture unit".
  In a fragment shader use a "texture2D" function to lookup a <br>color from the texture map image.
