  What is the difference between "Perlin Noise" and pure randomness?

  - "Perlin Noise" produces the same pattern for identical inputs; pure randomness
    would produce a different pattern every time.

    + Correct.

  - "Perlin Noise" produces a different pattern for identical inputs; pure randomness
    would produce the same pattern every time.

    - Incorrect.

  - "Perlin Noise" is strictly for computer graphics; randomness can be used for any application.

    - While true in one sense, there is a better answer amoung your choices.

  - "Perlin Noise" only works in shader programs; randomness can be used in any program.

    - Incorrect. "Perlin Noise" is an algorithm that can be implemented in any programming language
      for any purpose.
