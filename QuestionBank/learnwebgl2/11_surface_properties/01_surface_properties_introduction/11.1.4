  When is the transpose of the inverse of a transformation matrix, (M\ :sup:`-1`)\ :sup:`T`
  required for the correct placement of normal vectors into a scene?

  - when the transformation matrix includes non-uniform scaling.

    + Correct.

  - when the camera transformation matrix includes non-uniform scaling.

    - Incorrect. A camera transformation matrix contains only translation and rotation, never scaling.

  - when the transformation matrix includes any type of scaling.

    - Incorrect. Uniform scaling is fine. Only when non-uniform scaling is
      included is the special matrix, (M\ :sup:`-1`)\ :sup:`T`, required.
