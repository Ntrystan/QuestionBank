  Which of the following commands creates a **non-uniform** scaling transformation matrix?

  - :code:`matrix.scale(transform, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7)`

    + Correct. The three scale factors are not identical.

  - :code:`matrix.scale(transform, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)`

    - Incorrect. This does uniform scaling, but actually no scaling since the factors are all 1.0.

  - :code:`matrix.scale(transform, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0)`

    - Incorrect. This does uniform scaling.

  - :code:`matrix.scale(transform, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6)`

    - Incorrect. This does uniform scaling.
