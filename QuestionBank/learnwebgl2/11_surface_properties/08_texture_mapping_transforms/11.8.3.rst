  *Texture coordinates*, :code:`(s,t)`, must be changed to which of the following forms
  before being transformed by a transformation matrix?

  - :code:`(s,t,1)`

    + Correct. The :code:`1` in the 3rd position allows for translation.

  - :code:`(s,t,0)`

    - Incorrect. The :code:`0` in the 3rd position would cause the *texture coordinate* to act like a vector, not a location.

  - :code:`(s,t)` (the form does not need to change)

    - Incorrect. A 2-component location can't be multiplied by a 3-by-3 matrix.

  - :code:`(s,t,0,1)`

    - Incorrect.
