    What is the size of a *texture map* transformation matrix?

  - 3 rows, 3 columns.

    + Correct. The 3rd row and column allow for translation.

  - 4 rows, 4 columns.

    - Incorrect. A 4-by-4 matrix could be used, but require unnecessary calculations.

  - 2 rows, 2 columns. (Because there is only two values to transform: :code:`(s,t)`)

    - Incorrect. A 2-by-2 would only allow for scaling and rotation.

  - 2 rows, 3 columns

    - Incorrect. A 2-by-3 matrix does not have an inverse, which is sometimes
      needed to undo transformations.
