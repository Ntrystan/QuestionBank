  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The x scale factor is 2, while the scale factors of 1 for the y and z components leaves them unchanged.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This doubles the x, y and z components of all vertices.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This does not provide the 3 scaling parameters required by the function call.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. This doubles the z components, leaving the x and y components unchanged.

  Which of the following statements set a matrix called :code:`mary` to a
  scaling transformation that doubles only the x coordinates of a model?
