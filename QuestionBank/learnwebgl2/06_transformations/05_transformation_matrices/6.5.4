  :feedback_a: Correct. It scales the x coordinate by 2, mirrors the y coordinate, and scales the z coordinate by 3.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. (To be a translation, it needs non-zero values in the last column.)
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. (To be a rotation, it needs values in the upper-left 3-by-3 terms.)
  :feedback_d: Incorrect.
