  :answer_a: Transformation matrices are formatted differently based on whether they follow the pre or post multiply convention.
  :answer_b: Some web pages have incorrect information in them.
  :answer_c: There are many, many different ways to format transformation matrices.
  :answer_d: Transformation matrices vary based on the order they are applied to a problem.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. (This may be true, but it is not the primary reason.)
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. (There is really only two formatting conventions, based on pre or post multiplying.)
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. (Order changes the results of an overall transformation, but the format of individual transformations does not change -- assuming you stick to a single formatting convention.)

  Why must you be careful when using transformation matrices you find from google searches?
