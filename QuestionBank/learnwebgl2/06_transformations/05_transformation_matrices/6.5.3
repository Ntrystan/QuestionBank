  :feedback_a: Correct. It translates the x coordinate by 2, the y coordinate by 5, and the z coordinate by -3.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. (To be a rotation, it needs values in the upper-left 3-by-3 terms.)
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. (To be a scale, it needs scale factors down the diagonal.)
  :feedback_d: Incorrect.
