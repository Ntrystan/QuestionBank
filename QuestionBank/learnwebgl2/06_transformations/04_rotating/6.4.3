  :answer_a: in the direction of the global -X axis.
  :answer_b: in the direction of the global +X axis.
  :answer_c: in the direction of the global -Y axis.
  :answer_d: in the direction of the global +Z axis.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. Put your thumb along the Y axis and your fingers curl toward the X axis. Going -90 degrees goes in the opposite direction of the X axis.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect.

  By convention, we use the "right-hand-rule" for determining which direction is positive rotation.
  Therefore, rotating -90 degrees about the Y axis moves the Z axis where?
