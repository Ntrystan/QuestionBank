  :feedback_a: Correct. Addition is used for translation.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Multiplication performs scaling.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Division performs scaling.
  :feedback_d: Subtraction does perform translation, but we normally think of translation as pure addition. To move "backwards" you add a negative value.
