  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The x-axis component gets increased by 3 units and the y and z components do not change.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Translation acts on a vertex, which has 3 components. You need 3 translation values, even if 2 of the components are not changing.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This would move 3 units in the direction of the z axis.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Translation uses addition. (And you need 3 translation values, not just 1.)

  Translating a model 3 units in the direction of the x axis would use which translation values.
