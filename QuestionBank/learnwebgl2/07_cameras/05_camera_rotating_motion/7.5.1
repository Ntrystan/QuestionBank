  :feedback_a: Correct. Changing the center point moves the camera's line-of-sight but leaves the position of the camera unchanged.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. The up-vector does not control the camera's exact orientation.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The up-vector does not control the camera's exact orientation, but the center point does.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. The up-vector does not control the camera's exact orientation.

  To perform a **tilt** camera movement, which parameters of the :code:`lookAt`
  function must be changed?
