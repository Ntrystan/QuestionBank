  :answer_a: Two locations and one vector.
  :answer_b: Three locations.
  :answer_c: Three vectors.
  :answer_d: Two orthogonal vectors and two points.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. It specifies where the camera is and its orientation.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Perhaps a camera definition could be derived from the three points, but not from the values themselves.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Perhaps a camera definition could be derived from the three vectors, but not from the values themselves.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Perhaps a camera definition could be derived from the vectors and points, but not from the values themselves.

  What does the :code:`lookat` function need to know to derive a virtual camera definition?
