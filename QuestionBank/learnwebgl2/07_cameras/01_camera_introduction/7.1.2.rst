  :answer_a: A location and three orthogonal vectors.
  :answer_b: Four locations.
  :answer_c: Four vectors.
  :answer_d: Three orthogonal vectors.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. It specifies where the camera is and its orientation.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Perhaps a camera definition could be derived from the four points, but not defined by the values themselves.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Perhaps a camera definition could be derived from the four vectors, but not defined by the values themselves.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. This could define the camera's orientation, but we need a location as well.

  What is needed to mathematically define a virtual camera?
