  :answer_a: Translates the camera to the global origin and then aligns the camera's axes with the global coordinate system.
  :answer_b: Aligns the camera's axes with the global coordinate system and then translates the camera to the global origin.
  :answer_c: Aligns the camera's axes with the global coordinate system.
  :answer_d: Translates the camera to the global origin.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. It is important that the translation happens first, so that the rotation is about the origin.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. If the rotation is first, it will be about the global origin, which will also move the camera.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Yes, but it does more than just change the orientation.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Yes, but it does more than just change the location.

  A camera transformation performs the following tasks:
