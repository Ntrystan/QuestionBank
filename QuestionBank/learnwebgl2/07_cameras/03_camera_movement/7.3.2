  :feedback_a: Correct. You need to change the location of the camera.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Assuming the center point was already at the center of the model you are trying to circle around.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Typically you would not modify the orientation of the camera as you are "circling" -- but you could.

  you need to modify?
