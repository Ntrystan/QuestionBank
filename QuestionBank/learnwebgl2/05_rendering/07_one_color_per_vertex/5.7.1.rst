  :answer_a: a value that is automatically interpolated from its starting to ending value.
  :answer_b: a value that is automatically passed from the vertex shader to the fragment shader.
  :answer_c: a color value.
  :answer_d: a value that never changes; a constant.
  :correct: a,b
  :feedback_a: Correct. The values assigned by the vertex shader at the vertices are the starting and ending values.
  :feedback_b: Correct. "Varying" variables are always available to the fragment shader.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. In the examples in this lesson the varying variable was a color, but any type of value can be set up to be "varying".
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. It's called "varying" for a reason.

  A :code:`varying` variable in a shader program is ... (Select all that apply.)
