  Please correctly order the following **pre-processing steps** needed for rendering.
  -----
  Get the HTML *canvas* element you will be rendering into.
  =====
  Get a WebGL *context* for the canvas element.
  =====
  Compile and link your *vertex shader* and your *fragment shader* programs
  into a *rendering program*.
  =====
  For each model in your scene:

    #. Convert your OBJ model data into appropriate arrays of data for rendering.
    #. Create one or more *buffer objects* in the GPU's memory.
    #. Copy your model data into the *buffer object(s)*.
  =====
  Get references to the variables in your *shader rendering programs* so you can
  set their values at render time.
