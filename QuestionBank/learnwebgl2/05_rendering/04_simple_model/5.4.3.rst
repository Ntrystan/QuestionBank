  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. Change the y component in the (x,y,z) vertex.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This is the x component in the (x,y,z) vertex.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This is the z component in the (x,y,z) vertex.

  In the above WebGL program, which component of vertex 1 would need to be modified to raise the
  apex of the pyramid (it's highest point on the y axis) one unit higher?
  (Note that arrays are zero sub-scripted.)
