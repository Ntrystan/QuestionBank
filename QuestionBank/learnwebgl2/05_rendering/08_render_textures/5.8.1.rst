  :answer_a: 0 and 1.
  :answer_b: 0, 1, or 2.
  :answer_c: Any positive integer value greater than or equal to 0.
  :answer_d: Only 0 and 2.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The sum of the two floor() values will always be an integer, and the remainder of dividing any integer by 2 has to be 0 or 1, which is equivalent to saying all integers are either even or odd.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. It is not possible to get 2.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Mod(n,2) divides by 2 and returns the remainder as an integer.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect.

  Code in the example fragment shader in the above WebGL program uses a
  :code:`floor` function to to convert a floating point number to an integer,
  and a :code:`mod` function to get the remainder after division by 2.
  What are the only possible values this expression can return?
