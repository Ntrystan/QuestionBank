  A *stencil buffer* is desired that defines two separate "stencils".
  The low-order bit of each element in the *stencil buffer* will be used
  to define one "stencil", while the high-order bit will be used to define
  the second one. What two values should be used for the :code:`mask` parameter
  of the :code:`gl.stencilFunc` function to keep the stencils separate?

  - 0x01 and 0x80.

    + Correct.

  - 0xFF and 0x01.

    - Incorrect. 0xFF enables all 8 bits in the stencil values.

  - 0x02 and 0x04.

    - Incorrect. This uses the 2nd and 3rd low-order bits.

  - 0x0F and 0xF0

    - Incorrect. This uses 4 bits for each mask -- instead of one bit.
