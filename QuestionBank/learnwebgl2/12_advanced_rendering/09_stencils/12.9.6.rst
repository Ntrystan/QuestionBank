  A rendering pass is desired that increments a *stencil buffer* element
  if the "depth test" fails on a fragment.
  Which of the following parameters to :code:`gl.stencilOp` would accomplish this?

  - :code:`gl.stencilOp( gl.KEEP, gl.INCR, gl.KEEP )`

    + Correct.

  - :code:`gl.stencilOp( gl.KEEP, gl.KEEP, gl.INCR )`

    - Incorrect. The parameters are in the wrong position.

  - :code:`gl.stencilOp( gl.ZERO, gl.INCR, gl.ZERO )`

    - Incorrect. This also changes a *stencil buffer* element to zero when the "stencil test"
      fails or the "depth test" passes -- actions that are not desired.

  - :code:`gl.stencilOp( gl.KEEP, gl.REPLACE, gl.KEEP )`

    - Incorrect. This replaces the value of a *stencil buffer* element, it doesn't
      increment it.
