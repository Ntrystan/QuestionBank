  What are the two critical CSS properties that allow HTML elements to overlap
  each other on a web page?

  - :code:`position` and :code:`z-index`

    + Correct. :code:`position` allows them to be in the same place, while
      :code:`z-index` determines which one is in front.

  - :code:`position` and :code:`width/height`

    - Incorrect. The :code:`position` mode is critical, but width and height
      are not critical because they only determine the amount of overlap.

  - :code:`location` and :code:`size`

    - Incorrect. Neither of these are CSS properties.

  - :code:`position` and :code:`top`

    - Incorrect. The :code:`position` mode is critical, but :code:`top`
      is not critical because it only determines the amount of overlap.
