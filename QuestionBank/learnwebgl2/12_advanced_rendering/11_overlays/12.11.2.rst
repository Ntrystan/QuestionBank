  Given the following CSS definitions, which HTML element will be rendered in front
  of the other one?

  .. Code-Block:: CSS

    #element1 {
      position: absolute;
      z-index: 5;
    }

    #element2 {
      position: absolute;
      z-index: 3;
    }

  - :code:`element1`

    + Correct. Because it has a greater :code:`z-index`.

  - :code:`element2`

    - Incorrect. :code:`element2` will be below :code:`element1` because it has a smaller :code:`z-index`.
