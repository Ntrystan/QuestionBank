  If two separate models contain transparent surfaces and the models intersect in 3D space,
  what is required to render them accurately?

  - The models must be defined by high resolution triangular meshes and the models must be
    combined into a single model so that the triangles can be sorted and rendered back-to-front.

    + Correct.

  - The models must be defined using the minimal number of triangles and the models must be
    combined into a single model so that the triangles can be sorted and rendered back-to-front.

    - Incorrect. Using the minimal number of triangles means the triangles will intersect and
      can't be sorted in the proper order.

  - The models must be defined by high resolution triangular meshes and rendered separately,
    one at a time.

    - Incorrect.

  - The models must be defined by high resolution triangular meshes and the models must be
    combined into a single model so that the triangles can be sorted and rendered front-to-back.

    - Incorrect. The triangles must be rendered from back to front.
