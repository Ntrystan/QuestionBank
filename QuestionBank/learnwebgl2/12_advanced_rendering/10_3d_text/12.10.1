  Suppose the text string "Yeah" is needed in a 3D scene and it will never change.
  How many models are needed to render this string into the scene?

  - one

    + Correct.

  - four

    - Incorrect. It could be modeled as four separate characters, but why go to the trouble?

  - eight

    - Incorrect. Each character could be modeled using two separate models, but why?

  - none (just use the :code:`gl.renderText()` function)

    - Incorrect. No such function in the WebGL API exists.
