  The WebGL program above renders characters using models from a proportional font.
  How could the program be simplified if the characters were defined from a
  non-proportional font. (Select all that apply.)

  - The variable :code:`sizes` would not need to be an array; it could be a
    single set of MIN/MAX values.

    + Correct. Because each model would have the same size.

  - The doubly nested loop in :code:`_gatherCharacterInfo()` could be simplified
    to a single loop.

    + Correct. Because only one character would need to be tested for its size.

  - The height of the characters could be hard-coded instead of calculated.

    - Incorrect. The height could be hard-coded, but not because the font is non-proportional.

  - The depth along the z axis of the characters could be set to zero instead of calculated.

    - Incorrect. The depth could be hard-coded, but not because the font is non-proportional.
