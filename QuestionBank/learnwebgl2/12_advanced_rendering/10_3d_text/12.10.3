  How does the WebGL program above decide the width of a "space" character?

  - It uses the average width of all character models.

    + Correct.

  - It uses the width of the capital "A" character.

    - Incorrect. The capital "A" character is used to set the :code:`baseline`
      and :code:`character_height` values, but not the width of a space.

  - It uses the width of the model that describes a "space".

    - Incorrect. No such model is included in the character models. A "space"
      model has no geometry, so it has no model.

  - It uses the width of the "m" character.

    - Incorrect.
