  If light is blocked from hitting a surface, the surface should be colored using
  what type of lighting?

  - ambient light

    + Correct. Ambient light has no specific source. Therefore it can't be blocked.

  - diffuse light

    - Incorrect. Diffuse light must strike the surface and reflect off.

  - specular light

    - Incorrect. Specular light must strike the surface and reflect off.

  - attenuated light

    - Incorrect. The attenuation of light is the decrease in a light's intensity
      based on the distance between a light source and a surface.
