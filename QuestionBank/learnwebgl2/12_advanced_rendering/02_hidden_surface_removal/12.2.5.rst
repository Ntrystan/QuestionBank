  When should a bit-wise OR operator, :code:`|`, be used?

  - To combine bit-flags into a single value.

    + Correct.

  - To perform a boolean OR operation where the result is true if either value is true.

    - Incorrect. The boolean OR operation is double bars, :code:`||`

  - To add two bit-flags to get a single value.

    - Incorrect. The :code:`|` does not perform an addition operation, but if two bit-flags
      have different bits set, the result of a bit-wise OR and an algebraic addition
      produces the same result. (Always use the bit-wise OR!)

  - To combine two integers into their product.

    - Incorrect.
