  The *painter's algorithm* is simple but has the following flaws. (Select all that apply.)

  - Sorting graphic primitives based on their distance from the camera is slow.

    + Correct.

  - Sorting graphic primitives based on their distance from the camera requires
    the data that defines the graphic primitives be copied to the GPU over and over again.

    + Correct.

  - Graphic primitives that overlap in 3D space can't be sorted.

    + Correct.

  - Graphic primitive can be rendered in any order and still accomplish "hidden surface removal".

    - Incorrect.
