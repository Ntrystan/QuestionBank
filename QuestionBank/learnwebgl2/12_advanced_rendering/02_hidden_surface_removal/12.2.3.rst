    Which of the following are advantages of the z-buffer *hidden surface removal* algorithm? (Select all that apply.)

  - No sorting of the graphic primitives is required.

    + Correct.

  - It requires a trivial amount of extra memory.

    - Incorrect. The *depth buffer* requires a substantial about of memory.

  - It is super fast because it only processes surfaces that are visible.

    - Incorrect. Every pixel of every surface must be rendered even though many of them
      may never change the *color buffer*.

  - It's implementation is complex, but that's OK because it is really fast.

    - Incorrect. It's implementation is almost trival.
