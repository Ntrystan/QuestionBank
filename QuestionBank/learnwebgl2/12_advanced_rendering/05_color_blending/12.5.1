  Which of the following settings for blending produces transparency?

  - :code:`gl.blendFunc(gl.SRC_ALPHA, gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)`

    + Correct. The source color's amount is controlled by the source alpha's value,
      and the remaining percentage is used for the color already in the *color buffer*.

  - :code:`gl.blendFunc(gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, gl.SRC_ALPHA)`

    - Incorrect. The blending factors are reversed.

  - :code:`gl.blendFunc(gl.SRC_ALPHA, gl.DST_ALPHA)`

    - Incorrect.

  - :code:`gl.blendFunc(gl.SRC_COLOR, gl.DST_COLOR)`

    - Incorrect. This would add the colors, not blend them.
