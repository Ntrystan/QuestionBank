  When a new particle is added to a particle system, the initial values of its properties are typically ...

  - assigned a random value in some specified range (e.g., in the range [4,8]).

    + Correct.

  - assigned a specific, constant value.

    - Incorrect. Particle systems typically have some randomness.

  - assigned from a table lookup (from a table of potential initial values).

    - Incorrect. (Possible, but not typical.)

  - assigned a random value in the range [0.0, 1.0].

    - Incorrect. The values are typically random, but not from such a restricted range.
