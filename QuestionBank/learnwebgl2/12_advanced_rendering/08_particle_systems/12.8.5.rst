  Why are the particles in a particle system often sorted before rendering?

  - If the particles are transparent, the particles must be rendered from back to front.

    + Correct.

  - Some orderings of particles can better simulate a real world phenomenon.

    - Incorrect. A user can't determine the order that particles are rendered. A
      rendering is visible to a user only after it is totally finished.

  - Sorting according to size can make the smaller particles appear closer to the camera.

    - Incorrect. (That's silly!)

  - Sorting according to color can make the rendering faster.

    - Incorrect. (That's silly!)
