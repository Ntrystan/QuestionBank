  Particle data can be divided into two general types: 1) data needed for rendering,
  and 2) data needed for updating a particle after each animation frame. Rendering data
  must be copied to a GPU *vertex object buffer*; update data can be stored in JavaScript
  arrays. Which of the following particle properties typically needs to copied to
  the GPU before rendering?

  - color

    + Correct. The color of individual particles typically varies.

  - speed

    - Incorrect. The speed of a particle is used to update the location of a particle as it moves.

  - direction

    - Incorrect. The direction of a particle is used to update the location of a particle as it moves.

  - lifetime

    - Incorrect. The lifetime of a particle determines when a particle "dies".
