  What technique is used in the example WebGL program in this lesson to keep
  particle data in an array in contiguous array positions?

  - A particle that "dies" is overwritten by the last particle in an array.

    + Correct. And the number of particles is decreased by one.

  - Any particle that "dies" has its size set to -1.

    - Incorrect. (This technique could be used, but it does not keep the data in the array contiguous.)

  - Any particle that "dies" has its location set to (-999, -999, -999).

    - Incorrect. (This technique could be used, but it does not keep the data in the array contiguous.)

  - A particle that "dies" is overwritten by shifting all elements that have
    greater array indexes over by 1 in the array.

    - Incorrect. (This is very inefficient and should be avoided, if possible.)
