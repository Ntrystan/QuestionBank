  What is the value of the *fragment shader* input variable, :code:`gl_PointCoord`, for
  the pixel that is at the center of a point's rendering? (I.e., the exact location of a
  point?)

  - [0.5, 0.5]

    + Correct. This is the center of the point's square.

  - [0.0, 0.0]

    - Incorrect. No, this is the upper-left corner pixel.

  - [1.0, 1.0]

    - Incorrect. No, this is the lower-right corner pixel.

  - [0.75, 0.25]

    - Incorrect. No, this pixel is to the right of center, and up from the center, of
      the point's location.
