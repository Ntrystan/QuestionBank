  Anti-aliasing is a technique for ...

  - partially coloring adjacent pixels to the edge of a graphic primitive if an edge
    pixel is only partially covered by the edge.

    + Correct.

  - correcting aliasing, which is sampling error.

    - (Kind of correct, but really meaningless jargon.)

  - correcting errors.

    - (What kind of errors? Too vague!)

  - fixing the color of pixels at the center of a graphic primitive.

    - Incorrect. Anti-aliasing works at the edges of a graphics primitive, not its center.
