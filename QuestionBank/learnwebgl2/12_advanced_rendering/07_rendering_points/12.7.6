  What happens to the rendering of a point if the 3D location of the point is
  not inside the projection's clipping volume?

  - None of the point's square is rendered.

    + Correct. A point's square is rendered or not rendered based on whether a single
      3D location is inside the projection's clipping volume.

  - The portion of the point's square that is visible from the camera is rendered.

    - Incorrect.

  - The location of the point is modified in 3D space to guarantee its entire rendering.

    - Incorrect. The graphics pipeline never modifies geometric primitive data.

  - The alpha component of the point's color is modified to make the point fade out.

    - Incorrect. The graphics pipeline never modifies geometric primitive data.
