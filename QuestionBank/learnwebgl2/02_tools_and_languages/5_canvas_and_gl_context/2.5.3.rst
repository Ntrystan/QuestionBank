  :answer_a: WebGL remains in the same state it is in until it is told to change.
  :answer_b: WebGL is used to render maps of geographic states.
  :answer_c: WebGL is always in a state of change.
  :answer_d: WebGL commands must be issued over and over again for each new rendering.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. If you set the color to red, it stays red until it is changed to something else.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect, though WebGL could be used to draw maps.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect, WebGL only changes its "context" when WebGL commands are called.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. In fact, to make rendering as fast as possible, you should not make unnecessary WebGL function calls.
