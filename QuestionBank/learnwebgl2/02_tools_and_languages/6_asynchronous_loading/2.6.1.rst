  :answer_b: in the order they are specified: glpoint4.js, glvector3.js, glmatrix4x4.js, and then obj_to_arrays.js
  :answer_c: in reverse order to what they are specified: obj_to_arrays.js, glmatrix4x4.js, glvector3.js, and then glpoint4.js.
  :answer_d: an order based on their code dependencies.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The files could be retrieved in any order.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect, though they might be downloaded in this order.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect, though they might be downloaded in this order.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect, because JavaScript does not currently support code dependencies.
