   Does an *area* light source have to be modeled as a rectangle?

  - No, the shape of an area light source can be any geometric object.

    + Correct. The shape can be as complex as you want to make it. That is one
      of the advantages of *fragment shaders*.

  - Yes, it must be a rectangle.

    - Incorrect. It's your light model. You can make it as complex as you want!
