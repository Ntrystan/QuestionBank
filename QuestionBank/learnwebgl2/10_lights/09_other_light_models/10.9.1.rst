  To model a *sun* light source, what needs to be passed to a *fragment shader*? (Select all that apply.)

  - The direction of incoming light.

    + Correct. A vector that contains the direction the light is coming from.

  - The color of the sun's light.

    + Correct.

  - The location of the sun.

    - Incorrect. Knowing the location of the sun in a virtual scene is problematic.

  - The volume of the sun.

    - Incorrect. The sun is so far away, we typically model it as a single point,
      even though in real life the size of the sun is very large.
