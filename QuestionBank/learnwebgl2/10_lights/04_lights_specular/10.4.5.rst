  A reflection vector can be calculated using this equation: :code:`R = 2*n*dot_product(n,-L) + L`,
  or this equation: :code:`R = 2*n*dot_product(n,L) - L`. When should each equation be used?

  - first equation: :code:`L` goes from the light source to the fragment. :raw-html:`<br>`
    second equation: :code:`L` goes from the fragment to the light source. :raw-html:`<br>`

    + Correct.

  - first equation: :code:`L` goes from the fragment to the light source. :raw-html:`<br>`
    second equation: :code:`L` goes from the light source to the fragment. :raw-html:`<br>`

    - Incorrect.
