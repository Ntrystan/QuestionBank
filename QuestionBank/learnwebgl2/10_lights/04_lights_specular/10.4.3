  A vector from a fragment (in camera space) to the location of the camera can be
  calculated in the *fragment shader* using the statement: :code:`to_camera = -1.0 * v_Vertex;`.
  (See line 41.) Why?

  - The camera is at :code:`(0,0,0,1)` so :code:`camera_location - v_Vertex` simplifies to :code:`-1.0 * v_Vertex`.

    + Correct.

  - A vector to a location in space is simply the location treated as a vector.

    - Incorrect. This statement is true, but we want a vector from the fragment to the camera, which is in the opposite direction.

  - A location and a direction are basically the same thing.

    - Incorrect. NO! Locations and directions are very different.

  - Calculating a vector between two locations requires the subtract of the locations: "head minus tail."
    Therefore, getting a vector by multiplying by :code:`-1` is just a weird coincidence.

    - Incorrect.
