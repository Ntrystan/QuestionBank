  A reflection vector can be calculated using this equation: :code:`R = 2*n*dot_product(n,-L) + L`.
  What does :code:`n` represent?

  - The normal vector to the surface (normalized to unit length).

    + Correct.

  - The surface's normal vector.

    - Incorrect. It has the direction of the normal vector, but it must be normalized.

  - A "new" vector in the direction of the camera.

    - Incorrect.

  - A vector from the the light source to the fragment.

    - Incorrect. This is :code:`L` in the equation.
