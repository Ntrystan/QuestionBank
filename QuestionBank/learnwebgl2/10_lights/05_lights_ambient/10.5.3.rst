  How do you make ambient light represent "white" light?

  - Make all three components be the same value.

    + Correct.

  - Make the intensities be :code:`(1,1,1)`.

    - Incorrect. This is a "white" light source, but in general there are many other possibilities.

  - Set the ambient value to :code:`1.0`.

    - Incorrect. Ambient light is represented by a RGB triple, not a scalar.

  - Make the intensities be :code:`(0.5,0.1,0.3)`.

    - Incorrect. Since the red component is dominate, the ambient light would give a
      "reddish hue" to the scene.
