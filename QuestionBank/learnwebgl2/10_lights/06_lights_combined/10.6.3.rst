  What is the purpose for the *shader program* statement,
  :code:`color = clamp(color, 0.0, 1.0);`?

  - If a color component of fragment's color becomes more than 100%,
    it makes the color be 100%.

    + Correct.

  - It makes each color component either 0.0 or 1.0.

    - Incorrect. 0.0 and 1.0 are the min and max values, respectively. If the value is between 0.0
      and 1.0, the value remains unchanged.

  - It sets each color component to an average of the three values.

    - Incorrect. Nope!

  - It makes the color values more homogeneous.

    - Incorrect. That's silly!
