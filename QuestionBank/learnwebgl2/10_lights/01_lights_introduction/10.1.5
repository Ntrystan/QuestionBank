  In what geometric space will lighting calculations be perform in this textbook?

  - camera space

    + Correct. The camera is at the origin looking down the -Z axis, so we don't have to
      transfer the camera data to the *fragment shader* and some to the lighting calculations
      are simplified because the camera is at :code:`(0,0,0,1)`.

  - model space

    - Incorrect. The relationships between the models, camera, and lights has not been
      established for the scene.

  - scene space

    - Incorrect. Lighting calculations can be done in scene space, but the location and orientation
      of the camera must be copied to the *fragment shader* and some of the lighting calculations
      are more complex.

  - clipping space

    - Incorrect. The relationships between the models, camera, and lights is wrong because of
      the conversion to *normalized device coordinates*.
