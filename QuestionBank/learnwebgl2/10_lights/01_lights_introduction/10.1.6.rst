  How many transformation matrices will a *vertex shader* need when rendering a model?

  - Two, one to put geometry into camera space, and another to put geometry into clipping space.

    + Correct.

  - Only the :inline_matrixeq:`[projection]*[camera]*[model]` transform.

    - Incorrect. This puts geometry into clipping space and we need geometry in camera space to calculate lighting.

  - Three: the projection, camera, and model transformations.

    - Incorrect. If you pass these matrices as separate transformations, the *vertex shader*
      will have to multiply them together every time it processes a vertex, which will cause
      duplication of work and greatly slow down rendering.

  - Only one, the projection matrix.

    - Incorrect. The project matrix, by itself, is not very useful.
