  Why does a "point light source" not need a "direction" for modeling light (like
  the other lighting models)?

  - A point light source shines light in all directions.

    + Correct.

  - A point light source has an implied direction due to its location.

    - Incorrect.

  - A point light source is not inside the scene, and therefore its direction of light does not matter.

    - Incorrect.

  - A point light source can't send light in specific directions.

    - Incorrect. It actually sends light in all directions.
