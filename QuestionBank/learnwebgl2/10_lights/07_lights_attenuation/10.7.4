  :random:

  Using a combined light model, which of the following types of light
  should be attenuated? (Select all that apply.)

  - ambient light

    - Incorrect. Ambient light has no known source, so there is no "distance to the light"
      to allow for attenuation.

  - diffuse light from a point light source

    + Correct. The distance between the light source and the surface is known.

  - specular light from a point light source

    + Correct. The distance between the light source and the surface is known.

  - sun light

    - Incorrect. If the sun is being modeled, it is so far away from the scene
      that all objects whould have the same attenuation.
