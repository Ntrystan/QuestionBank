  :answer_a: increase the number of frames used for the motion.
  :answer_b: adjust the intermediate control points.
  :answer_c: adjust the starting and ending control points.
  :answer_d: make the path non-linear.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. Speed is distance divided by time. Increasing the time lowers the speed.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This will change the speed and acceleration but also the path's location.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This will change the speed and acceleration but also the path's location.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Not relevant.

  How can you make an object move more slowly along a path -- without changing the path's location?
