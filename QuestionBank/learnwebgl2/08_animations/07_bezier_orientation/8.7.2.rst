  :answer_a: n x u (cross product of n and u)
  :answer_b: u x n (cross product of u and n)
  :answer_c: v x n (cross product of v and n)
  :answer_d: u x v (cross product of u and v)
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. Using the "right-hand-rule," align your thumb with n, your index finder with u, and your middle finder will point in the direction of v.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This calculates -v because the order of the cross-product is wrong.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. You can't use v to calculate v.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. You can't use v to calculate v.

  If :code:`u` and :code:`n` are known, how can :code:`v` be calculated.
