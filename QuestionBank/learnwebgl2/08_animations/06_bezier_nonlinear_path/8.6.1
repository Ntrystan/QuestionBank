  :answer_a: Only if the four points are co-linear.
  :answer_b: true.

  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. If the four points do not define a straight line segment, only the first and last point are on the path.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. It only passes through the intermediate control points if all four points are co-linear.
  :feedback_c: Partially correct, but the path does pass through the control points if they define a straight line segment.

  The path defined by a Bezier parametric equation always passed through its four control points?
