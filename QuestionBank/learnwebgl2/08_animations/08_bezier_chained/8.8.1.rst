  What is required for a Bezier path to have a speed of zero at its starting location?

  - control-points :code:`p0` and :code:`p1` must be equal.

    + Correct. This make the vector :code:`<p1-p0>` be zero, which is the vector that controls speed when t=0.

  - the control-points must be co-linear.

    - Incorrect. Co-linear points make the path a straight line segment, but this does not control the speed of motion.

  - control-points :code:`p2` and :code:`p3` must be equal.

    - Incorrect. This is how you would make the speed zero at the end of the path.

  - control-points :code:`p1` and :code:`p2` must be equal.

    - Incorrect. This makes the acceleration zero at the mid-point of the path, but does not control speed.
