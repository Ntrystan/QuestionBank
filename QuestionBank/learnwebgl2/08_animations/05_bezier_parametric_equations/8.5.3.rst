  :answer_a: at p0 and p3.
  :answer_b: equally spaced along the path.
  :answer_c: equal to each other and at the path's midpoint.
  :answer_d: (1/4) the distance of the total motion.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This produces constant speed, but does not start with a speed of zero.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The speed is not zero when the motion starts.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. The speed is not zero when the motion starts.

  You want an object to move starting with a speed of zero and
  ending with a speed of zero. Where should the intermediate points
  be located?
