  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. You always get the starting point when t === 0.0.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. You get the ending point when t === 1.0.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. You would get the mid-point when t === 0.5.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. This location is not on the path for any value of t.

  Given :code:`p1` at :code:`(0,0,0)` and :code:`p2` at :code:`(10,0,0)`, what is the intermediate
  point between them when :code:`t=0.0`?
