  :feedback_a: Correct. Model the fish's body and then each individual fin.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. If you model the entire fish as a single model, you will not be able to move the fins independently of the fish's body.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Three models for the fins, but what about the body of the fish?
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. How did you get 9?

  You are modeling a fish that has 3 fins, one on either side of its body and its tail fin.
  You want to animate the fish to simulate its swimming through water. How many models should you create?
