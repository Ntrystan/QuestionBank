  :answer_a: The total number of triangles in the scene.
  :answer_b: The distance the camera is from the scene's action.
  :answer_c: The number of colors used for the scene's models.
  :answer_d: The size of the triangles in the models.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. For example, your scene might be limited to 10 models with a 1,000 triangles each.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. What is visible from the camera can impact the speed of a rendering, but it is typically not a limiting factor.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The number of colors used typically has no impact on the speed of rendering.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. The physical size of individual triangles changes depending on the distance between an object and the camera. We typically don't worry about the triangle sizes.

  To create real-time renderings at 30 frames per second, what is typically one of the
  limiting factors on the models in the scene?
