   :answer_b: 0
   :answer_c: 3628800
   :answer_d: Error - number is too big
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: That's the sum
   :feedback_b: That's what you get if you leave the sum as 0.  Multipying everything by 0 gets you 0
   :feedback_c: That's 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10
   :feedback_d: It should actually work

   Now, change the program above to get the product instead of the sum (e.g., replace `+` with `*`, and replace the `0` as the initial value of `sum` to `1`).  What do you get now when you run the program?
