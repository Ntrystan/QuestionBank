   :feedback_a: This still has four sides -- they are just numbered differently.
   :feedback_b: This would only draw 3 side since there are only 3 items in the list.
   :feedback_c: This still has four sides -- they are just numbered differently.
   :feedback_d: This <i>will</i> draw a square. The turtle will just go on to trace the first side twice.

   The numbers in the list ``[1,2,3,4]`` are not important.  It's the fact that there are *four* items in the list that is important.  Only one of these choices does *not* make a square.  Which one?  (It's not cheating to actually try each of them and run the program each time!)
