   :answer_a: It sets the red value in the current pixel to half the red of the original.
   :answer_b: It sets the red value in the current pixel to twice the red of the original.
   :answer_c: It sets the red value in the current pixel to 5 times the red of the original.
   :answer_d: It sets the red value in the current pixel to 0.5.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Multiplying by 0.5 is the same as dividing by 2.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was r * 2, instead of r * 0.5
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was r * 5, instead of r * 0.5
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was 0.5 instead of r * 0.5

   What does the line ``p.setRed(r * 0.5)`` do?
