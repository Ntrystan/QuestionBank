   :answer_a: square
   :answer_b: forward
   :answer_c: right
   :answer_d: All of the above
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: You can use square since you just defined it, but you can also use the others.
   :feedback_b: You can use forward because of the import, but you can also use others.
   :feedback_c: You can use right because of the import, but you can also use others.
   :feedback_d: Yes, you can use all of the turtle stuff from the import, plus the procedure square that was defined.

   Imagine that you add one more line to the program above.  Which procedure can you use safely, because it will have been defined?
