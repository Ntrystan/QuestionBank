   :answer_a: Two squares connected with a straight line
   :answer_b: Two triangles connected with a straight line
   :answer_c: Two rectangles connected with a straight line
   :answer_d: Nothing
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the right turns were 90 and there were four forwards
   :feedback_b: This procedure will draw a triangle and it is called twice so it draws two triangles
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the right turns were 90 and there were four forwards with two different forward amounts
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we only defined the procedure and didn't execute it.

   What will the following code draw?

   ::

      def shape(turtle):
          turtle.left(60)
          turtle.forward(100)
          turtle.right(120)
          turtle.forward(100)
          turtle.right(120)
          turtle.forward(100)
          turtle.right(120)

      from turtle import *
      space = Screen()
      luis = Turtle()
      shape(luis)
      luis.forward(200)
      shape(luis)
