   :feedback_a: This would print 10 first if lists started at index 0, but they start at index 1.
   :feedback_b: Remember that lists start at index 0.

   :feedback_d: Notice that second[2] is incremented.
   :feedback_e: That is okay.  We do not expect you to know this.

      first = [10,5,10,6]
      print (first[3])
      second = [3,1,-2]
      print (second)
      second[2] = second[2] + 1
      print (second[2])
