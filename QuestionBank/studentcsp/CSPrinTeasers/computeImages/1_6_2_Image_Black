   :answer_a: You still see the picture, but it is all in shades of gray.
   :answer_b: The picture is all white.
   :answer_c: The picture is all black.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Not if you set all the color values to 0.
   :feedback_b: Did you try it?  This would be true if you set all the values to 255 instead of 0.
   :feedback_c: Black is the absence of light so setting all colors to 0 results in an all black image since there is no light.

   What do you think happens when you set all the colors to 0?  Try adding ``p.setBlue(0)`` and ``p.setGreen(0)`` to the program above after the ``p.setRed(0)`` and run it to check.
