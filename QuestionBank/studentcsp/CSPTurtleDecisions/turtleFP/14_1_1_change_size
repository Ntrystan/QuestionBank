   :feedback_a: Use shape to set the shape used for the turtle.  It doesn't affect the line that is drawn.
   :feedback_b: Use this function to get the x value of the turtle's position
   :feedback_c: This changes the width of the line that the turtle draws as it moves.
   :feedback_d: Use color to change the line color and the turtle color.

   What procedure would you use to change the size of the line the turtle leaves when it moves?
