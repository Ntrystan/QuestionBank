   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Using a range of 12 will complete the pattern on this line, but what should it be to finish the pattern in the space?
   :feedback_b: This will stop in the middle of the last line of the pattern.  How many would fill the last row?
   :feedback_c: Each iteration of the loop draws one peak and there are 4 peaks per row.  There is room for 4 rows so the answer is 4 * 4 = 16.
   :feedback_d: This would try to draw on the line below the end of the drawing area.

   What value should you use for range in line 17 in the program above (td_pattern) to complete the pattern to fill the drawing space?
