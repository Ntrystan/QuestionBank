   :feedback_a: The find function returns the index of the first position that contains the given string.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was pos = str.find(" is").
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was pos = str.find(" is") and the first position was 1, but it is 0.

   What will be printed when the following executes?

   ::

     str = "His shirt is red"
     pos = str.find("is")
     print(pos)
