   :feedback_a: Incorrect. This does not compare two prices -- the variable 'max' is not a price, it is the index of the current max value.
   :feedback_b: Correct. This updates the value of max with 'i' if it is greater than the previous maximum price.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. This will not update the value of max with the highest price value.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. This assigns the price value to the variable max rather than the index value of the list itemList.

   A grocery store uses a database to store important statistics. The prices of all items are stored in a list called itemList, which is indexed from 1 to x. The company uses the following program to assign the index of the item in the store that has the highest price to the variable max.

   ::

     i ← 0
     max ← i + 1
     x ← LENGTH(itemList)
     REPEAT x times
     {
             i ← i + 1
             <MISSING CODE>
     }

   Which of the following code segments can replace <MISSING CODE> so that the program works as intended?


   (A)
   ::

     IF(itemList[i] > max)

     {
          max ← itemList[i]
     }


   (B)
   ::

     IF(itemList[i] > itemList[max])

     {
         max ← i
     }


   (C)
   ::

     IF(itemList[i] < itemList[max])

     {
         max ← i
     }

   (D)
   ::

     IF(itemList[i] > itemList[max])

     {
         max ← itemList[i]
     }
