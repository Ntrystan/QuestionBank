   :feedback_a: Incorrect. This data could be recorded since air temperature and time are both measured.
   :feedback_b: Correct. Data for only one year is recorded, so there is no way to measure average annual precipitation.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Since both air temperature and precipitation are recorded, this can be measured.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. This can be recorded since the temperature is recorded every day for 12 months.

   Which of the following questions about the Detroitâ€™s weather could NOT be accurately answered using only the data collected by the lab?
