   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct. Since 'weight' < 1 is True, 'price' equals 1.45. Both 'weight' and 'price' are being displayed.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Although 0.75 is the value of 'total,' it is never displayed.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Neither the value of weight nor price -- the two variables being displayed -- are equal to 0.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Although price is equal to 1.45, the value of weight is also being displayed by this code.

   Refer to the following code:

   ::

     weight ← 0.5
     IF weight < 1
      { price ← 1.45 }
     IF weight >= 1
      { price ← 1.15 }
     total ← weight * price
     DISPLAY(weight)
     DISPLAY(price)

   What will be printed?
