   :answer_a: Expected to run in reasonable time
   :answer_b: NOT expected to run in reasonable time
   :answer_c: Impossible to calculate
   :answer_d: Easier to do by hand
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Algorithms with exponential will continually change over time.
   :feedback_b: Correct. Since an exponential function is continually changing, it may not run in reasonable time.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. They can be solved for a specific value.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. It is not necessarily easier to calculate by hand.

   Algorithms will exponential behavior (e.g. x^n) are:
