   :answer_a: In no situation; this procedure works as intended
   :answer_b: In all situations; this procedure will DISPLAY the maximum, not the minimum
   :answer_c: If every item in the list is greater than zero
   :answer_d: If every item in the list is less than zero
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. This procedure does not work in every case.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. This code does obtain a minimum value, but fails to do so under certain circumstances.
   :feedback_c: Correct. If every item in the list is positive, "min" never gets updated because it is initialized to 0 and every value in the list is being compared to it.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. The code will work as intended if every value is negative.

   Imagine you want to create a procedure to find and print the smallest item in a list. Take the code below for example:


   ::

            PROCEDURE showMin(aList)

             {
              min ← 0

              FOR EACH item IN aList

               {
                if (min > item)

                 {
                         min ← item
                 }
               }
              DISPLAY(“smallest item in list is “ + min)
             }

   In what situation would this procedure fail to correctly display the minimum?
