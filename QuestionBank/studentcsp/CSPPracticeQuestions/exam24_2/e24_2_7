   Consider the following code snippet that takes a positive integer ‘n’ as input and answer the question that follows
   ::

    i <- 1
    REPEAT UNTIL i ≤ n
       IF i MOD 2 = 1
           DISPLAY(“ODD”)
       ELSE
           DISPLAY(“EVEN”)
       i <- i + 1

   Which of the following statements are true?
   ::

    I.   “ODD” is printed n/2 times if n is even
    II.  “ODD” is printed (n + 1)/2 times if n is odd
    III. “EVEN” is printed (n - 1)/2 times if n is odd
