   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. This would be true if the loop terminated at i = 2
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. This would be true if the loop terminated at i = 3
   :feedback_c: Correct. This is true since the loop runs 3 times and we are multiplying 'n' with 2 in each iteration.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. This would be true if the loop terminated at i = 5

   Trace the value of an integer variable ``n`` in the following code.
   ::

      i ← 1
      n ← 2
      REPEAT until i = 4
      {
         n ← n * 2
         i ← i + 1
      }

   What is the value of ``n`` after the above code executes?
