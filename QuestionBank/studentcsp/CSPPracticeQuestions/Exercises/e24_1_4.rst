   :answer_a: X = 155, Y = 1555
   :answer_b: X = 20, Y = 20
   :answer_c: X = 15, Y = 5
   :answer_d: X = 20, Y = 25
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Since 'X' and 'Y' are not strings, we cannot simply concatenate their characters.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. While the value of 'X' is correct in this answer choice, the final value of 'Y' is not.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. The values of both 'X' and 'Y' are incorrect in this answer choice.
   :feedback_d: Correct. Trace the code! Don't forget to use the updated value of 'X' while finding the value of 'Y' in the last statement.

   What is the final value of the integers ``X`` and ``Y`` after the following statements are executed?
   ::

     X ← 15
     Y ← 5
     X ← X + Y
     Y ← X + Y
