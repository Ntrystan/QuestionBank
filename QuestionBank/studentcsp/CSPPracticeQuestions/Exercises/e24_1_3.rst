   :answer_a: Yes, the code correctly switches the values of 'a' and 'b'.
   :answer_b: No, but it will work correctly if statements 1. and 3. are switched.
   :answer_c: No, but it will work correctly if statements 2. and 3. are switched.
   :answer_d: No, but it will work correctly if statements 1. and 2. are switched.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. In this case, the value of 'a' will remain unchanged although 'b' will correctly store the value of 'a'.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. In this case, the code will not compile as we are trying to assign the value of 'temp' to 'b' before giving a value to 'temp'.
   :feedback_c: Correct. Plug any values in 'a' and 'b' and trace the code! You will find that it works.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. In this case, the code will not compile as we are trying to assign the value of 'temp' to 'b' before giving a value to 'temp'.

   A programmer is writing code to switch the values of two integer variables, namely ``a`` and ``b``, using a temporary integer variable, ``temp``. This is the pseudo-code that the programmer has come up with:
   ::

     temp ← a  # statement 1.
     b ← temp  # statement 2.
     a ← b     # statement 3.

   Will the pseudo-code correctly perform the required task (assume that ``a`` and ``b`` are never numerically equal)?
