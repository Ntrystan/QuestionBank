   :answer_d: I., II. and III.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct. Statement I is true since it correctly identifies a property of lossless compression. Statement III is true becasue it correctly identifies the trade-offs involved in compression techniques.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Statement II is false since lossless compression can be applied to restore a file to its original state.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Statement II is false since lossless compression can be applied to restore a file to its original state.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Statement II is false since lossless compression can be applied to restore a file to its original state.

   Which of the following statements are true regarding compressing files?

   I. If lossless compression is applied, every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed.

   II. No matter what compression technique is used, once a data file is compressed, it cannot be restored to its original state.

   III. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is often much higher than through lossless techniques.
