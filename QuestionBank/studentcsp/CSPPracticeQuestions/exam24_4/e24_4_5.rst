   :feedback_a: Incorrect. We need to use metadata for this, particularly the names of users who send pictures.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. We need to use metadata for this, particularly the times at which pictures were taken and received as a message.
   :feedback_c: Correct. This answer choice is correct since we need to look at the actual picture, that is, the data in this case.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. We need to use metadata for this, particularly the number of users who downloaded the pictures.

   A certain mobile application allows its users to take pictures and send them to whoever they wish to on their contact list as an online message. If a user receives a picture, he may download the picture to save it or let the application automatically delete it within 24 hours of receiving the message. A picture itself is considered to be data. In addition to the data, the application stores the following metadata for all pictures:
    - The time the picture was taken, and the time the picture was received as a message
    - The name of the user who sent the picture and the names of users who received the picture
    - The number of users who downloaded the picture

    For which of the following goals would it be more useful to analyze the data instead of the metadata?
