   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was if x >= 5 and x <= 20:
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was if x > 5 and x <= 20:
   :feedback_c: It will print "condition true" when x is greater than or equal to 5 and less than 20.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was if x > 5 and x < 20:

   Given the code below, what describes the values of x that will cause the code to print "condition true"?

   ::

      if x >= 5 and x < 20:
          print ("condition true")
      print ("All done")
