   :feedback_a: This line will only print when score is less than 10.
   :feedback_b: This line will print whenever the score is more than 10, so if the value is 25 it will print first.  And then it will also print "Amazing!".
   :feedback_c: This line will print whenever the score is more than 20, but another line will print first.
   :feedback_d: The value 25 is more than 10.

   What is the first thing printed when the score is 25?
