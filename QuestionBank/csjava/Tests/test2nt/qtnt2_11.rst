   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if at the beginning of the second for loop, y was equal to 0, not to x. The starting value of y changes every time that x increases.
   :feedback_b: The code loops 15 times, and sum is incremented by 1 each time.
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if the for-loops both continued when the values were less than or equal to 5, not when the values were less than 5.
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if the for-loops both began at 0 and looped until the values were less than or equal to 5. Check the for loop structures.
   :feedback_e: This would be correct if the first for-loop began at 1, not at 0.

   Consider the following code. What is printed as a result of executing this code?

   .. code-block:: java

      int sum = 0;

      for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++)
      {
         for (int y = x; y < 5; y++)
         {
            sum++;
         }
      }

      System.out.println(sum);
