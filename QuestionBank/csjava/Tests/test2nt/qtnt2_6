   :feedback_a: Remember that subclasses do not inherit constructors from the parent class.
   :feedback_b: II is correct, but constructors are not inherited.
   :feedback_c: III is correct, but remember that all public methods are inherited by the subclass.
   :feedback_d: Subclasses inherit mutator and accessor methods from the parent class, but they do not inherit constructors or private instance variables.
   :feedback_e: Constructors and private instance variables are not inherited from the parent class. II and III are correct, but GoldenRetriever would not inherit the constructor or the private instance variables.

   The Dog class is shown below. The GoldenRetriever class inherits from the Dog class. Which methods and variables does the GoldenRetriever class inherit?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Dog
      {
         private int numLegs = 4;
         private String name = "Spot";

         public Dog(String theName)
         {
            /* implementation not shown */
         }

         public String bark()
         {
           return "Woof!";
         }

         public String getName()
         {
            return name;
         }

         public int getNumLegs()
         {
            return numLegs;
         }
      }

      I. public Dog(String theName)

      II. bark()

      III. getName()

      IV. private String name;
