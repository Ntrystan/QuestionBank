   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if the recursive method called 3 + mystery (num - 1). Check the recursive call and try again.
   :feedback_b: This method calculates 3 ^ num. 3 ^ 4 is not equal to 243, so check your tracing and try again.
   :feedback_c: This method calculates 3 ^ num. It goes through the recursive calls until num reaches 1, then 3 is multiplied by itself (num) times. The method has been called four times, and 3 ^ 4 is 81.
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if the recursive method called 3 + mystery (num - 1), and num was equal to 5. Check the base case and the parameter and try again.
   :feedback_e: This method calculates 3 ^ num. 3 ^ 4 is not equal to 27, so check your tracing and try again.


   Consider the method ``mystery``. What is returned as a result of ``mystery(4)``?

   .. code-block:: java

     public int mystery (int num)
     {
         if (num == 1)
             return 3;
         else
             return 3 * mystery (num - 1);
     }
