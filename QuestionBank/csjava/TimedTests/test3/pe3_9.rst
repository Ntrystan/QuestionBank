   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if k was printed when the reminder was equal to 1 (when the value was odd).
   :feedback_b: This code will loop through all the values from 0 to 19, but only print the ones that are even (dividing by 2 has a remainder of 0).
   :feedback_c: The first time through the loop k will have the value 0 and 0 % 2 returns 0 so the 0 will print.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the test was (k % 3 == 0) and the loop started with k = 1.
   :feedback_e: The loop will stop when k has the value of 20.  So it won't print a 20.

   What is printed when the following code is run?

   .. code-block:: java

      for (int k = 0; k < 20; k = k + 1)
      {
         if (k % 2 == 0)
            System.out.print(k + " ");
      }
