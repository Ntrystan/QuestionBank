   :answer_d: Whenever exactly 1 element in a is equal to val.
   :answer_e: Whenever the last element in a is equal to val.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: What is count for?
   :feedback_b: It only sets temp to true when count is greater than 1.
   :feedback_c: This increments count once for each value in a that is equal to val.  It returns true when count is greater than 1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was temp = count == 1.
   :feedback_e: This could be one line of code return (a[a.length-1] == val).

   Given the following code which of the answers best describes the conditions needed for temp to be true when it is returned?

   .. code-block:: java

      boolean temp = false;
      int count = 0;
      for ( int testVal : a)
      {
         if ( testVal == val ) count++;
      }
      temp = count > 1;
      return temp;
