   :answer_a: int[] nums = [5];
   :answer_b: int nums[5];
   :answer_c: int[] nums = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 };
   :answer_d: int[] nums; nums = new int[5];
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The left side is okay, but the right side is wrong.
   :feedback_b: This correctly declares an array of five integers.
   :feedback_c: This correctly declares and initializes an array of five integers.
   :feedback_d: This declares nums to be an array of integers and then creates the array.

   Which is NOT a correct way to declare an array of 5 integers?
