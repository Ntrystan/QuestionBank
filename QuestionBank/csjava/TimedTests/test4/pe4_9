   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The general formula for the number times a loop executes is the last value - the first value  + 1.  The outer loop will execute 3 times (2-0+1) and the inner loop will execute 7 times (7-1+1) so the total is 3 * 7 = 21.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the inner loop stopped when j equals 7.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the outer loop executed 4 times and the inner loop 8, but is that right?
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the outer loop executed 4 times, but is that right?
   :feedback_e: This would be true if you added the number of times the outer loop executes and the number of times the inner loop executes, but you multiply them.

   Consider the following code segment.  How many times will a * be printed?

   .. code-block:: java

     for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
     {
        for(int j = 1; j <= 7; j++)
           System.out.println("*");
     }
