   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was j < 3.
   :feedback_b: The variable j will range from 1 to 3 and k will range from 1 to 3.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was k <= 3.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was k <= 4.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if k started at 0 instead of 1.

   What will the following code print when it is executed?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        for (int k = 1; k < 4; k++)
           System.out.print(j * k + " ");
     }
