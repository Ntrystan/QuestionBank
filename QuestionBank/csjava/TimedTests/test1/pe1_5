   :answer_a: The search value is not in the array
   :answer_b: The search value is the last element in the array
   :answer_c: The value is in the middle of the array.
   :answer_d: The search value is the first element in the array.
   :answer_e: Sequential search can never be faster than binary search.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: If the search value is not in the array, a sequential search will have to check every item in the array before failing, a binary search will be faster.
   :feedback_b: In this case a sequential search will have to check every element before finding the correct one, whereas a binary search will not.
   :feedback_c: This would be true for a binary search, not for a sequential search.
   :feedback_d: Only when the search value is the first item in the array, and thus the first value encountered in sequential search, will sequential be faster than binary.
   :feedback_e: When the search value is the first element, sequential will always be faster, as it will only need to check one element whereas a binary search would start in the middle of the array and have to keep looking.

   Under which of these conditions will a sequential search be faster than a binary search?
