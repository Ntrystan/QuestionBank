   :answer_b: for
   :answer_c: for-each
   :answer_d: nested for loop
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: You can use a while loop, but it would make your code more error prone than another type of loop
   :feedback_b: You can use a for loop, but it would make your code more error prone than another type of loop
   :feedback_c: Since you need to loop through all the strings in the ArrayList in order, a for-each loop would be best
   :feedback_d: There is no need for a nested loop in this situation
   :optional:

   Which loop would be best for this situation?
