   :answer_a: The value is the first one in the array
   :answer_b: The value is in the middle of the array
   :answer_c: The value is the last one in the array
   :answer_d: The value isn't in the array
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true for sequential search, not binary.
   :feedback_b: If the value is in the middle of the array the binary search will return after one iteration of the loop.
   :feedback_c: How would that be the shortest in a binary search?
   :feedback_d: This is true for the longest execution time, but we are looking for the shortest.

   Which will cause the *shortest* execution of a binary search looking for a value in an array of integers?
