   :answer_a: The value is the first one in the array
   :answer_b: The value is in the middle of the array
   :answer_c: The value is the last one in the array
   :answer_d: The value isn't in the array
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This would only take one execution of the loop.
   :feedback_b: Are you thinking of binary search?
   :feedback_c: This would be true if you were starting at the last element, but the algorithm in the course description starts with the first element.
   :feedback_d: This is true for the longest execution time, but we are looking for the shortest.

   Which will cause the *shortest* execution of a sequential search looking for a value in an array of integers?
