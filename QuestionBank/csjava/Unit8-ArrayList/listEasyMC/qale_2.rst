   :answer_a: An array has faster access to its elements than a list does.
   :answer_b: An array knows it length, but a list doesn't know its length.
   :answer_c: An ArrayList can allocate more space than it needs.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Since an ArrayList is implemented by an array, it has the same access time.
   :feedback_b: Lists do know their length, but they don't make it public.
   :feedback_c: Every time an ArrayList fills up a new array is created that is twice as big.  This can lead to extra space that is wasted.

   Which of the following is a reason to use an array instead of an ArrayList?
