   :answer_a: The value is the first one in the array
   :answer_b: The value is in the middle of the array
   :answer_c: The value is the last one in the array
   :answer_d: The value isn't in the array
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be true for the shortest execution. This would only take one execution of the loop.
   :feedback_b: Why would this be the longest execution?
   :feedback_c: There is one case that will take longer.
   :feedback_d: A sequential search loops through the elements of an array or list starting with the first and ending with the last and returns from the loop as soon as it finds the passed value. It has to check every value in the array when the value it is looking for is not in the array.

   Which will cause the *longest* execution of a sequential search looking for a value in an array of integers?
