   What is the camel case variable name for a variable that represents a shoe size?

   -    :^\s*shoeSize$: Correct.  Start with the first word in all lowercase and uppercase the first letter of each additional word
        :.*: In camel case just appended the words after each other but uppercase the first letter of each word after the 1st word
