   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: While you could use an int and use 0 for false and 1 for true this would waste 31 of the 32 bits an int uses. Java has a special type for things that are either true or false.
   :feedback_b: Java has a special type for variables that are either true or false.
   :feedback_c: Java uses boolean for values that are only true or false.
   :feedback_d: While you can use a string to represent "True" or "False", using a boolean variable would be better for making decisions.

   What type should you use to record if it is raining or not?
