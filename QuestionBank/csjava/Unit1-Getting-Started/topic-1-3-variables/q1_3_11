   The following code declares and initializes variables for storing a number of
   visits, a person's temperature, and if the person has insurance or not.
   It also includes extra blocks that are not needed in a correct solution.
   Drag the needed blocks from the left area into the correct order
   (declaring numVisits, temp, and hasInsurance in that order) in the right area.
   Check your solution.
   -----
   int numVisits = 5;
   =====
   Int numVisits = 5; #paired
   =====
   double temp = 101.2;
   =====
   Double temp = 101.2;  #paired
   =====
   boolean hasInsurance = false;
   =====
   Boolean hasInsurance = false; #paired
