    Consider the following code segment.

    .. code-block:: java

       System.out.println("Roses are red, ")      // Line 1;
       System.out.println("Violets are blue, ")  // Line 2;
       System.out.print("Unexpected '}' ")        // Line 3;
       System.out.print("on line 32. ")           // Line 4;

    The code segment is intended to produce the following output but may not work as intended.

    .. raw:: html

       <pre>Roses are red,
       Violets are blue,
       Unexpected '}' on line 32.</pre>

    Which change, if any, can be made so that the code segment produces the intended output?

    - Replacing print with println on lines 3 and 4.

      - These should print on the same line without a newline in between.

    - Replacing println with print on lines 1 and 2.

      - These should print out with a newline in between.

    - Removing the single quotes in line 3.

      - The single quotes are fine in this line.

    - Putting the semicolon after the ) on each line.

      + Correct! The semicolon should go after each command but not in the comment.
