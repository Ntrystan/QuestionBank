   The following has all the correct code to print out "Hi my friend!" when the code is run,
   but the code is mixed up.  Drag the blocks from left to right and put them in the
   correct order.  You can scroll up and look at the previous example program if you
   are having trouble understanding how to order the blocks.

   Click on the "Check" button to check your solution.
   You will be told if any of the blocks are in the wrong order or if you need to
   remove one or more blocks.

   After three incorrect attempts you will be able to use
   the "Help me" button to make the problem easier.
