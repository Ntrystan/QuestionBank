   The code below makes an attempt to swap the values stored in the two variables x and y (so x ends up with y's initial
   value  of 5 and y ends up with x's initial value of 3).  Unfortunately this code has an error and does not work.
   Use the CodeLens to step through the code to understand why it fails to swap the values in x and y.

    public class ErrorSwap
    {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        int x = 3;
        int y = 5;
        System.out.println(x);  //3
        System.out.println(y);  //5
        x = y;
        y = x;
        System.out.println(x);  //should be 5
        System.out.println(y);  //should be 3
      }
    }
