   The following has the correct code that uses a third variable named "temp" to swap the
   values in x and y.

   The code is mixed up and contains <b>one extra block</b> which is not needed
   in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left into the correct
   order on the right, then check your solution.
   You will be told if any of the blocks are in the wrong order or if you need to remove
   one or more blocks.

   After three incorrect attempts you will be able to use the <i>Help Me</i> button to make the problem easier.
