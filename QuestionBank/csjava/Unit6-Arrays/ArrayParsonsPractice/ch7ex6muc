   The following program segment is a method that should return the largest integer given an array of integers (the parameter).  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>two extra blocks</b> that are not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed code from the left to the right and put them in order with the correct indention so that the code would work correctly.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution. </p>
