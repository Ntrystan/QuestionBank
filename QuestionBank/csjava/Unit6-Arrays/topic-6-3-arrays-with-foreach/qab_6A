   :feedback_a: This style of loop does access every element of the array, but using a for-each loop also means the user can access elements through the variable name.
   :feedback_b: Correct! For-each loops access all elements and enable users to use a variable name to refer to array elements, but do not allow users to modify elements directly.
   :feedback_c: For-each loops, as well as allowing users to refer to array elements, run through every element. For-each loops also do not allow users to modify elements directly.
   :feedback_d: For-each loops access all of an array's elements and allow users to refer to elements through a variable, but do not allow users to modify elements directly.


   What are some of the reasons you would use an enhanced for-each loop instead of a for loop?

   .. code-block:: java

      I: If you wish to access every element of an array.
      II: If you wish to modify elements of the array.
      III: If you wish to refer to elements through a variable name instead of an array index.
