   Can you change the index variable's value so that it prints out the puppy image? Can you print out the reindeer? Try all of them! What indices did you need to use? Then try using a random number for the index instead. Remember that (int)(Math.random()*max) will return a number from 0 up to max. What's the maximum number it can be for this array?

        // Change index to see different images in the array!
        // Can you have it pick out a random image?
