   :feedback_a: Remember that the first element in an array starts at index 0. If the length (the number of elements) of the array is 5, at what index would you find the last element?
   :feedback_b: Since the first element in an array is at index 0 the last element is the length minus 1.

   Which index is for the last element of an array called ``highScores``?
