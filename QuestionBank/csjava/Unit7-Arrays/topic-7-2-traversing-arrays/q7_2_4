   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would true if it looped through the whole array.  Does it?
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it looped from the beginning to the middle.  Does it?
   :feedback_c: It loops from the middle to the end doubling each value. Since there are 6 elements it will start at index 3.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if array elements didn't change, but they do.

   Given the following values of a and the method doubleLast what will the values of a be after you
   execute: doubleLast(a)?

   .. code-block:: java

      int[ ] a = {-20, -15, 2, 8, 16, 33};

      public static void doubleLast(int[] values)
      {

         for (int i = values.length / 2; i < values.length; i++)
         {
            values[i] = values[i] * 2;
         }
      }
