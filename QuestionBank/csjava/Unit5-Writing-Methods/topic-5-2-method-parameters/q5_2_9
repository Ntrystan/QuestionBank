    Consider the following methods:

    .. code-block:: java

        public static void inchesToCentimeters(double i)
        {
            double c = i * 2.54;
            printInCentimeters(i, c);
        }

        public static void printInCentimeters(double inches, double centimeters)
        {
            System.out.println(inches + "-->" + centimeters);
        }

        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            inchesToCentimeters(10);
        }

    What is printed when the main method is run?    It might help to draw out a stack diagram on paper, or use the CodeLens visualizer to step through the code.

    - inches --> centimeters

      - The values of the variables inches and centimeters should be printed out, not the words.

    - 10 -->  25

      - Two doubles should be printed, not two ints, and the centimeters should be 25.4

    - 25.4 --> 10

      - Inches should be printed before centimeters.

    - 10 --> 12.54

      - c = 10 * 2.54 = 25.4, not 12.54.

    - 10.0 --> 25.4

      + Correct! centimeters = 10 * 2.54 = 25.4.
