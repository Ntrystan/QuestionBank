   The print output shown in the upper right section of
   Figure 3 was produced by adding 3 method calls in the main method, which have been erased.
   Drag the needed blocks from the left area below into the correct order  in the right area
   to produce the print output shown in Figure 2:
   -----
   mystery( 5 );
   =====
   mystery( "5" ); #paired
   =====
   mystery( "hello");
   =====
   mystery( hello);  #paired
   =====
   mystery( 9, "bye");
   =====
   mystery( "bye", 9); #paired
