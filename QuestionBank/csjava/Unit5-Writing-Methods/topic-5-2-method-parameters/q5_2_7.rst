   :answer_c: print1 and main;
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Method print1 accesses num, which is a formal parameter with method level scope.
   :feedback_b: Method main can accesses the local variable age, since it is declared in the main method.
   :feedback_c: Variable age is declared in the main method, so it can't be accessed in the print1 method.

   The variable ``age`` is visible in which method(s)?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Visibility {

        public static void print1(int num) {
          System.out.println("num is " + num);
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int age = 20;
            print1(age);
        }
      }
