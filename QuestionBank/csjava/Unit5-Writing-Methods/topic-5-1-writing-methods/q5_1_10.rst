   :answer_a: line 21 in method main.
   :answer_b: line 6 in method o.
   :answer_c: line 16 in method m.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. The stack diagram shows method n was called by method m.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. The stack diagram shows method n was called by method m.
   :feedback_c: Correct. The stack diagram shows method n was called by method m.

   Notice the n() method is called both in method o() and method m().
   The stack diagram shows the current execution
   trace.  After line 12 executes and the n() method completes,
   control will return to which line in which method?
