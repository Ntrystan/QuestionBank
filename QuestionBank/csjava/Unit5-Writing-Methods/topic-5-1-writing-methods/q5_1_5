   Given the GreetingExample class in the previous problem, how many times is  **System.out.println** called in total when the program runs?

   -    :4: Correct.
        :.*: Incorrect. The main method calls System.out.println directly 2 times, and the call to greet() results in 2 additional calls to System.out.println.
