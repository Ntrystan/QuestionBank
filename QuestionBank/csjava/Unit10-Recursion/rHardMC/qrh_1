   :answer_a: The string <code>s</code> contains two or more of the same characters.
   :answer_b: The string <code>s</code> starts with two or more of the same characters.
   :answer_c: The string <code>s</code> contains two or more of the same character that are next to each other.
   :answer_d: The string <code>s</code> ends with two or more of the same characters
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: It is not enough for <code>s</code> to contain two of the same characters, they must be adjacent to satisfy <code>s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(1)</code>.
   :feedback_b: It is not neccessary for the adjacent characters to be at the start of the string.
   :feedback_c: This method will return true when <code>s</code> has at least 2 characters in it and at least 2 characters are the same and are adjacent.
   :feedback_d: It is not neccessary for the adjacent characters to be at the end of the string.

   Given the following method declaration, this method will return true if and only if:

   .. code-block:: java

      public static boolean check(String s)
      {
         return s.length() >= 2 &&
                (s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(1) ||
                 check(s.substring(1)));
      }
