   :answer_a: The values don't matter this will always cause an infinite loop.
   :answer_b: Whenever a has values larger then temp.
   :answer_c: When all values in a are larger than temp.
   :answer_d: Whenever a includes a value equal to temp.
   :answer_e: Whenever a includes a value that is equal to zero.
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: An infinite loop will not always occur in this program segment. It occurs when at least one value in a is less than or equal to 0.
   :feedback_b: Values larger then temp will not cause an infinite loop.
   :feedback_c: Values larger then temp will not cause an infinite loop.
   :feedback_d: Values equal to temp will not cause the infinite loop.
   :feedback_e: When a contains a value equal to zero then multiplying that value by 2 will always be 0 and never make the result larger than the temp value (which was set to some value > 0), so an infinite loop will occur.

   Which of the following will cause an infinite loop when ``temp`` is greater than zero and ``a`` is an array of integers.

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int k = 0; k < a.length; k++ )
     {
        while (a[k] < temp )
        {
           a[k] *= 2;
        }
     }
