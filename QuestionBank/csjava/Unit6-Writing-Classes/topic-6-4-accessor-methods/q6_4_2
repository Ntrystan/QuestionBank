    Consider the following class definition. The class does not compile.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Student
        {
            private int id;
            public getId()
            {
                return id;
            }
            // Constructor not shown
        }

    The accessor method getId is intended to return the id of a Student object. Which of the following best explains why the class does not compile?

    - The id instance variable should be public.

      - Instance variables should be private.

    - The getId method should be declared as private.

      - Accessor methods should be public methods.

    - The getId method requires a parameter.

      - Accessor methods usually do not require parameters.

    - The return type of the getId method needs to be defined as void.

      - void is not the correct return type.

    - The return type of the getId method needs to be defined as int.

      + Correct! Accessor methods have a return type of the instance variable they are returning.
