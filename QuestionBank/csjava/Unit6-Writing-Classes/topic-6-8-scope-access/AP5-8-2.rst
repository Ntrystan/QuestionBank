    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Movie
        {
            private int currentPrice;
            private int movieRating;

            public Movie(int p, int r)
            {
                currentPrice = p;
                movieRating = r;
            }

            public int getCurrentPrice()
            {
                int currentPrice = 16;
                return currentPrice;
            }

            public void printPrice()
            {
                System.out.println(getCurrentPrice());
            }
        }

    Which of the following reasons explains why the printPrice method is "broken" and only ever prints out a value of 16?

    - The private variables currentPrice and movieRating are not properly initialized.

      - The constructor will initialize them.

    - The private variables currentPrice and movieRating should have been declared public.

      - Instance variables should be private.

    - The printPrice method should have been declared as private.

      - Methods are usually public.

    - currentPrice is declared as a local variable in the getCurrentPrice method and set to 16, and will be used instead of the instance variable currentPrice.

      + Correct!

    - The currentPrice instance variable does not have a value.

      - Accessor methods are usually public.
