    Consider the definition of the Cat class below. The class uses the instance variable isSenior to indicate whether a cat is old enough to be considered a senior cat or not.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Cat
        {
            private String name;
            private int age;
            private boolean isSenior;
            public Cat(String n, int a)
            {
                name = n;
                age = a;
                if (age >= 10)
                {
                    isSenior = true;
                }
                else
                {
                    isSenior = false;
                }
            }
        }

    Which of the following statements will create a Cat object that represents a cat that is considered a senior cat?

    - Cat c = new Cat ("Oliver", 7);

      - The age 7 is less than 10, so this cat would not be considered a senior cat.

    - Cat c = new Cat ("Max", "15");

      - An integer should be passed in as the second parameter, not a string.

    - Cat c = new Cat ("Spots", true);

      - An integer should be passed in as the second parameter, not a boolean.

    - Cat c = new Cat ("Whiskers", 10);

      + Correct!

    - Cat c = new Cat ("Bella", isSenior);

      - An integer should be passed in as the second parameter and isSenior would be undefined outside of the class.
