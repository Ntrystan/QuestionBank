   :answer_b: I and II
   :answer_c: I and III
   :answer_d: I, II, and III
   :answer_e: II and III
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: I is one of the correct constructors but the second constructor can also be used.
   :feedback_b: II is not correct because there is no Cat constructor that takes 2 parameters.
   :feedback_c: I and III call the correct constructors.
   :feedback_d: II is not correct because there is no Cat constructor that takes 2 parameters.
   :feedback_e: II is not correct because there is no Cat constructor that takes 2 parameters.

    Consider the following class. Which of the following successfully creates a new Cat object?

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Cat
        {
            private String color;
            private String breed;
            private boolean isHungry;

            public Cat()
            {
                color = "unknown";
                breed = "unknown";
                isHungry = false;
            }

            public Cat(String c, String b, boolean h)
            {
                color = c;
                breed = b;
                isHungry = h;
            }
        }

        I.   Cat a = new Cat();
        II.  Cat b = new Cat("Shorthair", true);
        III. String color = "orange";
             boolean hungry = false;
             Cat c = new Cat(color, "Tabby", hungry);
