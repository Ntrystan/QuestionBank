    The Liquid class will contain two double attributes for a liquidâ€™s boiling point temperature and freezing point temperature. The class will also contain a constructor.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
           /* missing code */
        }
        Which of the following replacements for /* missing code */ is the most appropriate
        implementation of the class?

    - .. code-block:: java

        private double boilingPoint;
        private double freezingPoint;
        public Liquid(double boilingPoint, double freezingPoint)
        { /* implementation not shown */ }

      + Correct! The instance variables should be private and the constructor and methods should be public.

    - .. code-block:: java

        private double boilingPoint;
        private double freezingPoint;
        private Liquid(double boilingPoint, double freezingPoint)
        { /* implementation not shown */ }

      - Constructors should be public.

    - .. code-block:: java

        private double boilingPoint;
        public double freezingPoint;
        private Liquid(double freezingPoint, double boilingPoint)
        { /* implementation not shown */ }

      - The instance variables should be private and the constructor and methods should be public.

    - .. code-block:: java

        public double boilingPoint;
        public double freezingPoint;
        private Liquid(double boilingPoint, double freezingPoint)
        { /* implementation not shown */ }

      - The instance variables should be private and the constructor and methods should be public.

    - .. code-block:: java

          public double freezingPoint;
          public double boilingPoint;
          public Liquid(double freezingPoint, double boilingPoint)
          { /* implementation not shown */ }

      - The instance variables should be private.
