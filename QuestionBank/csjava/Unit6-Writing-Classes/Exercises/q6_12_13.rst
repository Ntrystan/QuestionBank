    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
            private int currentTemp;
            private int boilingPoint;

            public Liquid(int ct, int bp)
            {
                currentTemp = ct;
                boilingPoint = bp;
            }

            public void changeTemp(int newTemp)
            {
                currentTemp = newTemp;
            }

            public void increaseTemp(int howMuch)
            {
                currentTemp = newTemp + howMuch;
            }

        }

    Which of the following best explains why the class will not compile?

    - The class is missing an accessor method.

      - The class does not necessarily need an accessor method.

    - The instance variables currentTemp and boilingPoint should be  public instead of private.

      - Instance variables are usually private.

    - The Liquid constructor needs a return type.

      - Constructors do not have return types.

    - The Liquid class is missing a constructor.

      - The class includes a constructor.

    - The variable newTemp is not defined in the increaseTemp method.

      + Correct! newTemp is defined in a different method. The instance variable currentTemp should be used instead.
