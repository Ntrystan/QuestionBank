    Consider the definition of the Party class below. The class uses the instance variable numOfPeople to indicate how many people are at the party.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Party
        {
            private int numOfPeople;
            private String partyHost;

            public Party (String name, int people)
            {
                partyHost = name;
                numOfPeople = people;
            }
        }

        Which of the following statements will create a Party object
        that represents a party that has three people at it?

    - Party p = new Party ("Natasha", "3");

      - An int should be passed in as the second parameter, not a String.

    - Party p = new Party ("Eduardo", 3);

      + Correct

    - Party p = new Party ("Emillio", "three");

      - An int should be passed in as the second parameter, not a string.

    - Party p = new Party ("Bob", three);

      - The word three would be treated as an undeclared variable here.

    - Party p = new Party ("Billie", "2+1");

      - Strings cannot perform addition.
