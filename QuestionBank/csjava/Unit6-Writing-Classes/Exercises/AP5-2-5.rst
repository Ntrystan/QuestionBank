   Consider the following class definition. Each object of the class Party will store the party hostâ€™s name as partyHost, the number of people as numOfPeople, and the capacity that the event can hold as capacity. Which of the following code segments, found in a class other than Party, can be used to create a party hosted by Charlie without anyone there initially, but the place can hold 78 people ?

   .. code-block:: java

    public class Party
    {
        private String partyHost;
        private int numOfPeople;
        private int capacity;

        public Party(String name, int num, int cap)
        {
            partyHost = name;
            numOfPeople = num;
            capacity = cap;
        }
        public Party (String name, int cap)
        {
            partyHost = name;
            numOfPeople = 0;
            capacity = cap;
        }
        /* Other methods not shown */
    }

    I.   Party b = new Party("Charlie", 78);
    II.  Party b = new Party("Charlie", 0, 70+8);
    III. Party b = new Party("Charlie", 0, 78);
