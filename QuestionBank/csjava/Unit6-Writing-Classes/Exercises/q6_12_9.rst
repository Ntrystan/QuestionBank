    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
            private int currentTemp;

            public Liquid(int temp)
            {
                currentTemp = temp;
            }

            public int getTemp()
            {
              return currentTemp;
            }

            public void resetTemp(int new_temp)
            {
                currentTemp = new_temp;
            }
        }

    Consider the following code segment, which appears in a method in a class other than Liquid. The code segment does not compile.

    .. code-block:: java

        Liquid liq = new Liquid(50);
        System.out.println("The temperature of the liquid is " + liq.currentTemp);

    Which of the following best identifies the reason the code segment does not compile?

    - The Liquid class constructor should not have a parameter.

      - The constructor does have a parameter.

    - The resetTemperature method does not return a value that can be printed.

      - This is a void mutator method.

    - The private instance variable cannot be accessed from outside the class unless the accessor method is used.

      + Correct! The currentTemp instance variable is private and cannot be accessed outside of the class but the public accessor method getTemp() can be used instead.

    - The getTemp method cannot be called from outside the Liquid class.

      - The getTemp accessor method should be used from outside the class.

    - currentTemp does not have a value.

      - currentTemp is initialized to a value by the constructor but it is private and cannot be accessed outside the class.
