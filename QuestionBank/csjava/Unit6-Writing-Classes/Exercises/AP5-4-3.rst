   Consider the following Liquid class. The currentTemperature is stored in the method’s int attribute. The getCurrentTemp method is intended to allow methods in other classes to access a Liquid object’s currentTemperature value; however, it does not work as intended. Which of the following best explains why the getCurrentTemperature method does NOT work as intended?

   .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
            private int currentTemperature;

            public Liquid(int ct)
            {
                currentTemperature = ct;
            }

            public void getCurrentTemperature()
            {
                return currentTemperature;
            }
        }

   - The getCurrentTemperature method should be declared as private.

     - Accessor methods should be public methods.

   - The return type of the getCurrentTemperature method should be int.

     + Correct! The return type should match the type of the variable being returned.

   - The getCurrentTemperature method should have at least one parameter.

     - Get methods do not need parameters.

   - The variable currentTemperature is not declared inside of the getCurrentTemperature method.

     - currentTemperature is an instance variable that is shared by all the methods in the class.

   - The instance variable ct should be returned instead of currentTemperature.

     - The getCurrentTemperature method does not have access to the ct variable which is the parameter for the constructor.
