    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
            private int currentTemp;

            public Liquid(int temp)
            {
                currentTemp = temp;
            }

            public void resetTemp()
            {
                currentTemp = newTemp;
            }
        }

    Which of the following best identifies the reason the class does not compile?

    - The constructor header does not have a return type.

      - The constructor should not have a return type.

    - The resetTemp method is missing a return type.

      - Mutator methods usually have a void return type.

    - The constructor should not have a parameter.

      - Constructors can have parameters.

    - The resetTemp method should have a parameter.

      + Correct! The resetTemp method should have a parameter for the newTemp value to set the currentTemp.

    - The instance variable currentTemp should be public instead of private.

      - Instance variables should be private variables.
