   :answer_a: StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(1000)
   :answer_b: tr.addDailysteps(1000);
   :answer_c: tr.activeDays();
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This is a call to the constructor.
   :feedback_b: No, addDailySteps(1000) probably adds the given steps to an instance variable as a mutator method.
   :feedback_c: Yes, activeDays() is an accessor method that returns the number of active days (a great instance variable!).

   Which of the following methods is an accessor method that returns the value of an instance variable?
