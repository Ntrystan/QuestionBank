   The following program segment should print out all the values from 20 to 30 (20, 21, 22, ... 30). But, the blocks have been mixed up.  Drag the blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.

   -----
   int x = 20;
   =====
   while (x <= 30) {
   =====
       System.out.println(x);
   =====
       x++;

   }
