   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if x started at 1 instead of 0.
   :feedback_b: The loop starts with x = 0 and ends when it reaches 5 so 5 - 0 = 5.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the condition was x <= 5 instead of x = 5.

   How many times does the following method print a ``*``?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++)
     {
        System.out.print("*");
     }
