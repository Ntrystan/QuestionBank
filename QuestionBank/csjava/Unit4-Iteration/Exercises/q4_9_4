   :answer_d: 13
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it stopped when i was 12, but it loops when i is 12.
   :feedback_b: Note that it stops when i is 13 so 13 - 5 is 8.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if i started at 1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if i started at 0.

   How many times does the following method print a ``*``?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int i = 5; i <= 12; i++)
     {
        System.out.print("*");
     }
