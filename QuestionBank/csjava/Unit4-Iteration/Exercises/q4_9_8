   :feedback_a: This loop starts with x = 2 and continues while it is less than 8 so 8 - 2 = 6.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the loop ended when x was 9 instead of 8 (x <= 8).
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the loop started with x = 0.

   How many times does the following method print a ``*``?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int x = 2; x < 8; x++)
     {
        System.out.print("*");
     }
