   :answer_a: liquid.freeze(80);
   :answer_b: liquid.freeze();
   :answer_c: liquid.increaseTemp();
   :answer_d: liquidfreeze();
   :answer_e: liquid.freeze;
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Method freeze() does not have parameters.
   :feedback_b: Correct
   :feedback_c: There is no method increaseTemp() in the Liquid class definition.
   :feedback_d: The dot operator is required between the object name and the method name.
   :feedback_e: Parentheses are required after a method name.

    Consider the following class. Assume that the Liquid object liquid has been properly declared and initialized in a method in a class other than Liquid.  Which of the following statements are valid?

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Liquid
        {
          private double boilingPoint;
          private double freezingPoint;
          private double currentTemp;

          public Liquid(double b)
          {
            boilingPoint = b;
          }

          void lowerTemp()
          {
            currentTemp -= 10;
          }

          void raiseTemp()
          {
            currentTemp += 10;
          }

          void freeze()
          {
            currentTemp = freezingPoint;
          }
        }
