    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Party
        {
            private int numInvited;
            private boolean partyCancelled;

            public Party()
            {
                numInvited = 1;
                partyCancelled = false;
            }

            public void inviteFriend()
            {
                numInvited++;
            }

            public void cancelParty()
            {
                partyCancelled = true;
            }
        }

    Assume that a Party object called myParty has been properly declared and initialized in a class other than Party.  Which of the following statements are valid?

    - myParty.cancelParty();

      + Correct!

    - myParty.inviteFriend(2);

      - The method inviteFriend() does not have any parameters.

    - myParty.endParty();

      - There is no endParty() method in the class Party.

    - myParty.numInvited++;

      - This would cause an error because you cannot access the private instance variables of an object outside of the class.

    - System.out.println( myParty.cancelParty() );

      - This would cause an error because the void method cancelParty() does not return a String that could be printed out.
