   The following code uses a turtle to draw the digital number 7, but the lines are mixed up.
   Drag the code blocks to the right and put them in the correct order to first
   draw the line going up (towards the top of the page) and then turn and draw a
   line to the left to make a 7. Remember that the turtle is facing the top of the
   page when it is first created.
