   :answer_e: You will get an index out of bounds exception
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The method substring(a,b) means start at a and stop before b. The method substring(a) means start at a and go to the end of the string. The first character in a string is at index 0.
   :feedback_b: This can't be true since the e is at index 1 and s2 = s1.substring(2) will start at index 2 and take all characters till the end of the string.
   :feedback_c: This can't be true since the e is at index 1 and s2 = s1.substring(2) will start at index 2 and take all characters till the end of the string.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if substring(a,b) included the character at index b, but it doesn't.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if the starting index was invalid or the ending index was past 2 past the last valid index.

   What is output from the following code?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s = "Georgia Tech";
     String s1 = s.substring(0,7);
     String s2 = s1.substring(2);
     String s3 = s2.substring(0,3);
     System.out.println(s3);
