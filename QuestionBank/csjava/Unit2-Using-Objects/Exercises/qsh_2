   :answer_c: It will give a run-time error
   :answer_d: 138
   :answer_e: It will give a compile-time error
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if it was System.out.println(13 + 5 + 3), but the 13 is a string.
   :feedback_b: This is string concatenation.  When you append a number to a string it get turned into a string and processing is from left to right.
   :feedback_c: You can append a number to a string in Java. It turns the number into a string and then appends the second string to the first string.
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if it was System.out.println("13" + (5 + 3)), but the 5 is turned into a string and appended to the 13 and then the same is done with the 3.
   :feedback_e: You can append a number to a string in Java.  It will compile.

   What does the following code print?

   .. code-block:: java

     System.out.println("13" + 5 + 3);
