   :feedback_b: The first character is at index 0 in a string, not 1.
   :feedback_c: Does the indexOf method find the first occurrence of the character, or the last?
   :feedback_d: Does the string contain a d?  The pos method will return the first index that the character is at in the string.

   What is the value of pos after the following code executes?

     String s1 = "ac ded ca";
     int pos = s1.indexOf("d");
