    Consider the following methods, which appear in the same class.

    .. code-block:: java

        public void splitPizza(int numOfPeople)
        {
            int slicesPerPerson = 8/numOfPeople;
            /* INSERT CODE HERE */
        }

        public void printSlices(int slices)
        {
            System.out.println("Each person gets " + slices + " slices each");
        }

    Which of the following lines would go into ``/* INSERT CODE HERE */`` in the method splitPizza in order to call the ``printSlices`` method to print the number of slices per person correctly?

    - printSlices(slicesPerPerson);

      + Correct! If you had 4 people, slicesPerPerson would be 8/4=2 and printSlices would print out "Each person gets 2 slices each".

    - printSlices(numOfPeople);

      - If you had 4 people, this would print out that they get 4 slices each of an 8 slice pizza.

    - printSlices(8);

      - This would always print out 8 slices each.

    - splitPizza(8);

      - This would not call the printSlices method.

    - splitPizza(slicesPerPerson);

      - This would not call the printSlices method.
