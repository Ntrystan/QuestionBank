   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: You must use the new keyword to create a new Turtle.
   :feedback_b: All turtle constructors must take a world as a parameter.
   :feedback_c: This creates a Turtle object and places it in the center of the world.
   :feedback_d: You can not assign a Turtle object to a variable declared to have type World.

   Which of these is valid syntax for creating and initializing a Turtle object in the center of the world?
