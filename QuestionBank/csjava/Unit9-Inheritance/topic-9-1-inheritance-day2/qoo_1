   :answer_a: Create one class PublishedMaterial with the requested attributes.
   :answer_b: Create classes Book and Movie and each class has the requested attributes.
   :answer_c: Create the class PublishedMaterial and have Book and Movie inherit from it all the listed attributes.
   :answer_d: Create one class BookStore with the requested attributes.
   :answer_e: Create classes for PublishedMaterial, Books, Movies, Title, Price, ID, Authors, DatePublished
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This will complicate the process of retrieving objects based on their type. Also if we need to add information that is specific to Book or Movie, it would be best if these were subclasses of PublishedMaterial.
   :feedback_b: This involves writing more code than is necessary (usually people copy and paste the shared code) and makes it harder to fix errors. It would be better to put common attributes and methods in the superclass PublishedMaterial and have Book and Movie be subclasses.
   :feedback_c: We will need to get objects based on their type so we should create classes for Book and Movie. They have common attributes so we should put these in a common superclass PublishedMaterial.
   :feedback_d: The class name, BookStore, seems to imply the thing that keeps track of the store. This would be an appropriate class name for an object that handles the items in the Bookstore. However, for the published material, it would be better to use a superclass PublishedMaterial and subclasses for Books and Movies.
   :feedback_e: This is more classes than is necessary. Items such as Title, Price, ID, and DatePublished are simple variables that do not need a class of their own but should be attributes in a PublishedMaterial superclass, with Movies and Books as subclasses.

    An online store is working on an online ordering system for Books and Movies. For each type of Published Material (books and movies) they need to track the id, title, date published, and price. Which of the following would be the best design?
