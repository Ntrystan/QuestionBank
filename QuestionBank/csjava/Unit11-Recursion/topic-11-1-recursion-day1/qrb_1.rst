   :answer_a: Yes
   :answer_b: No
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Where is the call to the same method?
   :feedback_b: There is no call to the same method, so this can not be a recursive method. It uses iteration instead.

        Is the following method recursive?

    .. code-block:: java
      :linenos:

      public static int mystery()
      {
         int total = 0;
         for (int i=10; i>0; i--)
         {
            total = total + i;
         }
         return total;
      }
