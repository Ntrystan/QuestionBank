   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, any method that contains at least one call to the same method is recursive.
   :feedback_b: Look again.  Check if the method contains a call to itself.

   Is the following method recursive?

    .. code-block:: java
      :linenos:

      public static int mystery2(int x)
      {
         if (x == 1) return 1;
         else return x + mystery2(x-1);
      }
