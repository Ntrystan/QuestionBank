   :answer_a: Yes
   :answer_b: No
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: While the <code>toString</code> method exists and correctly creates the name string, it is not called by a <code>getName</code> method.
   :feedback_b: Since there is no <code>getName</code> method this point can not be awarded.

   Should the student earn 1 point for correctly constructing the string to return from ``getName`` and making it available to be returned?
