   :answer_a: Because x < 2 is always true
   :answer_b: Because there is a semicolon ; at the end of the condition "if (x < 2) ;"
   :answer_c: Because Java makes a random decision
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect, 3 < 2 is always false so the print statement should never execute
   :feedback_b: Correct.  Get rid of the ; at the end of the condition "if (x < 2) "
   :feedback_c: Incorrect, 3 < 2 is always false so the print statement should never execute

   Consider the following code segment. Why does it always print "ERROR"?

   .. code-block:: java

     int x = 3;
     if (x < 2) ;
     {
         System.out.println("ERROR");
     }
