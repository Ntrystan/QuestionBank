   :answer_c: You will get a error because you can't divide by zero.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Since (y / x) == 3 is the first expression it is executed, and x is 0 causing a divide by zero error.
   :feedback_b: Since (y / x) == 3 is the first expression it is executed, and x is 0 causing a divide by zero error.
   :feedback_c: Correct. Since (y / x) == 3 is the first expression it is executed, and x is 0 causing a divide by zero error.

   What is printed when the following code executes and x has been set to zero and y is set to 3?

   .. code-block:: java

     if ((y / x) == 3 || x == 0 )
     {
        System.out.println("first case");
     }
     else
     {
        System.out.println("second case");
     }
