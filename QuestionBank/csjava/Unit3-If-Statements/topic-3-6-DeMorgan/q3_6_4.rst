   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: The negation of y > 4 is y <= 4
   :feedback_b: Don't forget that the and is changed to an or
   :feedback_c: Don't forget that the and is changed to an or
   :feedback_d: The and is changed to an or, the (x == 2) becomes (x != 2) and (y > 4) becomes (y <= 4)

   Which of the following is the same as the code below?
