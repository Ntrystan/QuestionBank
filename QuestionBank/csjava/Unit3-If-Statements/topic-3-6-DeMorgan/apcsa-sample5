   :answer_a: The value is always true.
   :answer_b: The value is always false.
   :answer_c: The value is true when a has the value false, and is false otherwise.
   :answer_d: The value is true when b has the value false, and is false otherwise.
   :answer_e: The value is true when either a or b has the value true, and is false otherwise.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Try simplifying !(b ||a) or consider what happens if a and b are true.
   :feedback_b: Yes, a && !(b || a) = a && !b && !a. Since (a && !a) can never be true, the result will always be false.
   :feedback_c: Try the expression with a = false. Is the result true?
   :feedback_d: Try the expression with b = false with a = true and then try it with a = false. Is the result ever true?
   :feedback_e: Try the expression with a = true. Is the result true?

    Which of the following best describes the value of the Boolean expression: a && !(b || a)
