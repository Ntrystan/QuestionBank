   :answer_a: s1 == s3 && s1.equals(s3)
   :answer_b: s2.equals(s3) && s1.equals(s3)
   :answer_c: !(s1 == s2) && !(s1 == s3)
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Since s3 uses the new operator it will not refer to the same object as s1.
   :feedback_b: Do s2 and s3 have the same characters in the same order?
   :feedback_c: All of the variables refer to different objects.  But, s1.equals(s3) would be true since they have the same characters in the same order.

   Which of the following is true after the code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = new String("hi");
     String s2 = new String("bye");
     String s3 = new String("hi");
