   :feedback_a: The second time through the loop the value of num is 2 and 2 % 3 is 2 not 1.
   :feedback_b: The while loop will iterate 8 times. The value of num each time through the loop is: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. The corresponding remainder operator of 3 is: 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, which is print to the console.
   :feedback_c: The loop will iterate 8 times not 9. When the value of num exceeds 14, num will no longer be evaluated against the conditional statements. The remainder operator of 3 will be evaluated on the num values of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14.
   :feedback_d: The value of num the first time through the loop is 0 so the first remainder is 0 not 2. This would be true if the value of num was 2 to start.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if the loop stopped when the value of num was less than 14 but it is less than or equal to 14.

   Given the following code segment, what is printed when it executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     public static void test()
     {
       int num = 0;
       while(num <= 14)
       {
         if(num % 3 == 1)
         {
            System.out.print("1 ");
         }
         else if (num % 3 == 2)
         {
            System.out.print("2 ");
         }
         else
         {
            System.out.print("0 ");
         }

         num += 2;
       }
    }
