    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Cat
        {
            private String color;
            private boolean isHungry;
            /* missing constructor */
        }

    The following statement appears in a method in a class other than Cat. It is intended to create a new Cat object c with its attributes set to "black" and true. Which of the following can be used to replace  **missing constructor code** in the class definition so that the object c below is correctly created?

    .. code-block:: java

        Cat c = new Cat("black", true);

    - .. code-block:: java

        public Cat(String c, boolean h)
        {
            c = "black";
            h = true;
        }

      - The constructor should be changing the instance variables, not the local variables.

    - .. code-block:: java

        public Cat(String c, boolean h)
        {
            c = "black";
            h = "true";
        }

      - The constructor should be changing the instance variables, not the local variables.

    - .. code-block:: java

        public Cat(String c, boolean h)
        {
            c = color;
            h = isHungry;
        }

      - The constructor should be changing the instance variables, not the local variables.

    - .. code-block:: java

        public Cat(String c, boolean h)
        {
            color = black;
            isHungry = true;
        }

      - The constructor should be using  the local variables to set the instance variables.

    - .. code-block:: java

        public Cat(String c, boolean h)
        {
            color = c;
            isHungry = h;
        }

      + Correct!
