   :answer_a: The class is missing an accessor method.

   :feedback_c: There is a scope violation. Constructors do not have return types.
   :feedback_d: There is a scope violation. The updatedAmountOfFood variable is a local variable in another method.
   :feedback_e: There is a scope violation.
   :correct: d

   Consider the following class definitions. Which of the following best explains why the class will not compile?

   .. code-block:: java

        public class Party
        {
            private int boxesOfFood;
            private int numOfPeople;

            public Party(int people, int foodBoxes)
            {
                numOfPeople = people;
                boxesOfFood = foodBoxes;
            }

            public void orderMoreFood(int additionalFoodBoxes)
            {
                int updatedAmountOfFood = boxesOfFood + additionalFoodBoxes;
                boxesOfFood = updatedAmountOfFood;
            }

            public void eatFoodBoxes(int eatenBoxes)
            {
                boxesOfFood = updatedAmountOfFood - eatenBoxes;
            }
        }
