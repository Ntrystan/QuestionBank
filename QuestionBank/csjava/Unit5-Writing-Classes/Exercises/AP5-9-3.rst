    Consider the following class definitions.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Party
        {
            private String partyHost;
            private int monthOfParty;
            private int partyStartTime;

            public Party (String h, int month, int startTime)
            {
                partyHost = h;
                monthOfParty = month;
                partyStartTime = startTime;
            }

            public int getMonth()
            {
                return monthOfParty;
            }

            public int getStartTime()
            {
                return partyStartTime;
            }

            public String getHost()
            {
                return partyHost;
            }

            public void addToOptions(PartyOptions o)
            {
                o.addParty(this);
            }
        }

        public class PartyOptions
        {
            private int onlyThisMonth;

            public PartyOptions(int month)
            {
                onlyThisMonth = month;
            }

            /* A Party should only be added to this PartyOption if the partyâ€™s month matches onlyThisMonth */
            public void addParty(Party p)
            {
                if (p.getMonth() == onlyThisMonth)
                {
                    System.out.print("Party by " + p.getHost() + " accepted; ");
                }
                else
                {
                    System.out.print("Party by " + p.getHost() + " rejected; ");
                }
            }
        }


    Consider the following code segment, which appears in a class other than Party or PartyOptions.

    .. code-block:: java

        Party p1 = new Party("Kerry", 10, 7);
        Party p2 = new Party("Jules", 9, 6);

        PartyOptions options = new PartyOptions(10);
        p1.addToOptions(options);
        p2.addToOptions(options);

    - Party by Kerry rejected; Party by Jules rejected;

      - Kerry's party should be accepted because it is in the 10th month.

    - Party by Kerry rejected; Party by Jules accepted;

      - Kerry's party should be accepted because it is in the 10th month. Jules' party should be rejected because it is not in the 10th month.

    - Party by Kerry accepted; Party by Jules rejected;

      + Kerry's party is accepted because it is in the 10th month, and Jules' party is not.

    - Party by Kerry accepted; Party by Jules accepted;

      - Jules' party should be rejected because it is not in the 10th month.
