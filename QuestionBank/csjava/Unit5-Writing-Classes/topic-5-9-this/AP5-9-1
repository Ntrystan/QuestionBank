    Consider the following class definitions.

    .. code-block:: java

       public class Pay
       {
        private double pay;

        public Pay(double p)
        {
            pay = p;
        }

        public double getPay()
        {
            return pay;
        }

        public void calculatePayWithOvertime()
        {
            // this Pay object is passed to the Overtime constructor
            Overtime ot = new Overtime(this);
            pay = ot.getOvertimePay();
        }
       }

       public class Overtime
       {
        private double payWithOvertime;

        public Overtime(Pay p)
        {
            payWithOvertime = p.getPay() * 1.5;
        }
        public double getOvertimePay()
        {
            return payWithOvertime;
        }
       }

    The following code segment appears in a class other than Pay or Overtime.

    .. code-block:: java

        Pay one = new Pay(20.0);
        one.calculatePayWithOvertime();
        System.out.println(one.getPay());

    What, if anything, is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

    - 10.0

      - The pay starts at 20 and then increases with overtime.

    - 15.0

      - If the pay started at 10, this would be the result.

    - 20.0

      - The pay starts at 20 and then increases with overtime.

    - 30.0

      + Correct! The pay starts at 20 and then increases with overtime by multiplying by 1.5.

    - Nothing is printed because the code will not compile.

      - Incorrect. The code will compile.
