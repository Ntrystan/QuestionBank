    Consider the following Party class. The getNumOfPeople method is intended to allow methods in other classes to access a Party objectâ€™s numOfPeople instance variable value; however, it does not work as intended. Which of the following best explains why the getNumOfPeople method does NOT work as intended?

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Party
        {
            private int numOfPeople;

            public Party(int num)
            {
                numOfPeople = num;
            }

            private int getNumOfPeople()
            {
                return numOfPeople;
            }
        }
