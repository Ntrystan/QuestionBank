    :answer_a: /* Precondition: s <= 0 */
    :answer_b: /* Precondition: score >= 0 */

    :answer_d: /* Precondition: n is not the empty String */
    :answer_e: /* Precondition: studentName is not the empty String */
    :correct: c, d
    :feedback_a: It is not reasonable the s which sets the score should be negative.
    :feedback_b: The precondition should be about the parameters of the constructor. score is not the parameter variable.
    :feedback_c: Correct. It is reasonable that the score and extraCredit should be set to positive values using the parameters s and ec.
    :feedback_d: Correct. It is reasonable that the parameter n which sets the name should be not empty.
    :feedback_e: The precondition should be about the parameters of the constructor. score is not the parameter variable.

    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class TestScore
        {
            private String studentName;
            private double score;
            private double extraCredit;

            public TestScore (String n, double s, double ec)
            {
                studentName = n;
                score = s;
                extraCredit = ec;
            }
            /* Other methods not shown */
        }

     Which of the following preconditions are reasonable for the TestScore constructor?
