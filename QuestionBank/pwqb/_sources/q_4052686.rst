       <p><strong>2014_Q4:</strong></p><p>The general form of a for loop is as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">for ( initialisation ; condition ; increment ) {</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; ... body ...</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">}</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are four main components to a for loop: <em>initialisation</em>, <em>condition</em>, <em>increment</em> and <em>body</em>. When a for loop executes, these four components are usually executed in a very particular order. However, it is possible that two of these four components are not executed at all. For a given for loop, which two components <em>might not</em> be executed?</p>
