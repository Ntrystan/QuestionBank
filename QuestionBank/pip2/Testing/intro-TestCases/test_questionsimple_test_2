   :feedback_a: You might not notice the error, if the code just produces a wrong output rather generating an error. And it may be difficult to figure out the original cause of an error when you do get one.
   :feedback_b: Test cases let you test some pieces of code as you write them, rather than waiting for problems to show themselves later.
   :correct: b

   Test cases are a waste of time, because python interpreter will give an error
   message when the program runs incorrectly.
