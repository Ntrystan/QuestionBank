   :answer_a: No
   :answer_b: Yes
   :feedback_a: Every else-block must have exactly one corresponding if-block.  If you want to chain if-else statements together, you must use the else if construct, described in the chained conditionals section.
   :feedback_b: This will cause an error because the second else-block is not attached to a corresponding if-block.
   :correct: b

   Will the following code cause an error?

   .. code-block:: python

     x = -10
     if x < 0:
         print "The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here."
     else:
         print x, " is a positive number"
     else:
         print "This is always printed"
