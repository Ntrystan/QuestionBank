   :answer_b: You would like to be able to see or revert to any past version of any of the files in your project
   :answer_c: You want to collaborate with others, working in parallel on a project and merging your changes together occasionally
   :answer_d: You would like your code to automatically be checked for syntax errors
   :answer_e: You would like to distribute your code in a public repository that others can easily fork or comment on
   :feedback_a: If you just want compression, use one of the compression programs like gzip or compress.
   :feedback_b: git makes all of your past saved versions accessible.
   :feedback_c: git lets multiple work independently on files. If you work on separate parts of a file, it will merge them automatically. If two people edit the same line, then git will mark where there are conflicts and you can resolve them manually.
   :feedback_d: There are programs like lint that automatically check for syntax and coding style errors, but they are not an integral part of revision control system.
   :feedback_e: Sites like github, bitbucket, and assembla provide a way to publicly share repositories.
