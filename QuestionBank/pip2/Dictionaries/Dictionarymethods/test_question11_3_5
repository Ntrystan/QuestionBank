   :feedback_a: Add the values that have keys longer than 3 characters, not those with exactly 3 characters.
   :feedback_b: Yes, the for statement iterates over the keys.  It adds the values of the keys that have length greater than 3.
   :feedback_c: This is the accumulator pattern.  Total starts at 0 but then changes as the iteration proceeds.
   :feedback_d: Not all the values are added together.  The if statement only chooses some of them.
   :correct: b


   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. sourcecode:: python

      total = 0
      mydict = {"cat":12, "dog":6, "elephant":23, "bear":20}
      for akey in mydict:
         if len(akey) > 3:
            total = total + mydict[akey]
      print total
