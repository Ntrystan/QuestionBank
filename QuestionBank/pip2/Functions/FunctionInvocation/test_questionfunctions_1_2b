   :feedback_a: Here the the function is invoked and there is also a separate print statement.
   :feedback_b: There is only one print statement outside the funciton, but the invocations of hello also cause lines to print.
   :feedback_c: There are three print statements, but the function is invoked more than once.
   :feedback_d: Each time the function is invoked, it will print two lines, not one.
   :feedback_e: Three invocations generate two lines each, plus the line "It works"

      hello()
      print "It works"
