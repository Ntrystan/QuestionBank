   name = "Sally"
   greeting = "Nice to meet you"
   s = "Hello, {}. {}."

   print s.format(name,greeting) # will print Hello, Sally. Nice to meet you.

   print s.format(greeting,name) # will print Hello, Nice to meet you. Sally.

   print s.format(name) # 2 {}s, only one interpolation item! Not ideal.
