    Now try rearranging these code fragments to make a function that counts all the *leaf* items in a nested list like nested1 above, the items at the lowest level of nesting (8 of them in nested1).

    def count_leaves(n):
    =====
        count = 0
    =====
        for L in n:
    =====
            for x in L:
    =====
                count = count + 1
    =====
        return count
