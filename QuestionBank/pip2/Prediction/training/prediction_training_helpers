    IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
    University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course
    prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,
    I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant
    Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before
    I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at
    Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and
    was already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many
    other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded
    in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once
    entered upon my new duties.

    The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
    nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and
    attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of
    Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which
    shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have
    fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the
    devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a
    pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.

    Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had
    undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to
    the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved
    so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little
    upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse
    of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and
    when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and
    emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost
    in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the
    troopship "Orontes," and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with
    my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal
    government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.

    I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as
    air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will
    permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to
    London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of
    the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at
    a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless
    existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely
    than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that
    I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate
    somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in
    my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making
    up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less
    pretentious and less expensive domicile.

    On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at
    the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning
    round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at
    Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is
    a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never
    been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,
    and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the
    exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and
    we started off together in a hansom.

        "Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough
    to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce
    all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this
    system of imprisonment?"

    "Yes, sir."

    "And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of
    the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."

    "That was it, sir."

    "But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should
    be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain
    arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your
    interests were the same as his."

    "Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said
    Mrs. Toller serenely.

    "And in this way he managed that your good man should have no
    want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment
    when your master had gone out."

    "You have it, sir, just as it happened."

    "I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for
    you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And
    here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
    Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,
    as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
    questionable one."

    And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
    copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but
    was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of
    his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
    probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
    difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
    married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
    flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
    the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
    Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
    interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
    of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
    Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
