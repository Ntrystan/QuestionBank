    # example of the flag pattern

    x = True

    while x:
        entered = int(raw_input("Enter a number: "))
        print entered
        if entered % 2 == 0:
            x = False
            # Any code under here will execute
            print "Sorry, you entered an even number. The loop is over now!"


    # This is a flag for whether an even number has been entered
    # Effectively: enter odd numbers, loop will quit, using the flag pattern, when you enter something else
    # And if you don't enter a number, you'll get an error
