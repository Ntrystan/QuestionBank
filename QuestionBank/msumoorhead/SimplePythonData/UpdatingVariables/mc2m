   :answer_d: Nothing.  An error occurs because x can never be equal to x - 1.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The value of x changes in the second statement.
   :feedback_b: In the second statement, substitute the current value of x before subtracting 1.
   :feedback_c: Yes, this statement sets the value of x equal to the current value minus 1.
   :feedback_d: Remember that variables in Python are different from variables in math in that they (temporarily) hold values, but can be reassigned.
