   :feedback_a: 6 is in the wrong list.  alist[1] refers to the second item in alist, namely [888,999].
   :feedback_b: 8 is in the wrong list.  alist[1] refers to the second item in alist, namely [888,999].
   :feedback_c: Yes, alist[0][1][0] is True and alist[1] is the second list, the first item is 888.
   :feedback_d: alist[0][1][0] is True.  Take another look at the if statement.

   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [ [4, [True, False], 6, 8], [888, 999] ]
     if alist[0][1][0]:
        print(alist[1][0])
     else:
        print(alist[1][1])
