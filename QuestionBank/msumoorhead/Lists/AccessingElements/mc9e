   :answer_a: Error, you cannot use the upper method on a list.
   :answer_b: 2
   :answer_c: CAT
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: alist[2] is the string cat so the upper method is legal
   :feedback_b: 2 is the index.  We want the item at that index.
   :feedback_c: Yes, the string cat is upper cased to become CAT.
