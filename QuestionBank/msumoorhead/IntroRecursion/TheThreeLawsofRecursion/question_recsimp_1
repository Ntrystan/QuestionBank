   :feedback_a: There are only five numbers on the list, the number of recursive calls will not be greater than the size of the list.
   :feedback_b: The initial call to listsum is not a recursive call.
   :feedback_c: the first recursive call passes the list [4,6,8,10], the second [6,8,10] and so on until [10].
   :feedback_d: This would not be enough calls to cover all the numbers on the list
