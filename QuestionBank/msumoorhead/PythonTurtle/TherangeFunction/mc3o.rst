  :answer_a: No other value would give the same sequence.
  :answer_b: The only other choice is 14.
  :answer_c: 11, 13, or 14
  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: The sequence produced has steps of 4: 2, 6, 10.  The next would be 14, but it is not before the limit 12.  There are other limit choices past 10, but not past 14.
  :feedback_b: 14 would work:  It is also past 10, and not past 14, but there are other integers with the same properties.
  :feedback_c: Yes, any integer past 10, and not past the next step at 14 would work.

  What could the second parameter (12) in range(2, 12, 4) be replaced with and generate exactly the same sequence?
