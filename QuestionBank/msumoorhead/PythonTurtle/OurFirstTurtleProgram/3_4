   The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital L in white on a blue background as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/BlueTurtleL.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" /> but the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up and create the turtle and set the pen size to 10.  The turtle should then turn to face south, draw a line that is 150 pixels long, turn to face east, and draw a line that is 75 pixels long.   Finally, set the window to close when the user clicks in it.<br /><br /><p>Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.  Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order.</p>
