   :answer_c: Output c
   :answer_d: It will cause an error because every if must have an else clause.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Because -10 is less than 0, Python will execute the body of the if-statement here.
   :feedback_b: Python executes the body of the if-block as well as the statement that follows the if-block.
   :feedback_c: Python will also execute the statement that follows the if-block (because it is not enclosed in an else-block, but rather just a normal statement).
   :feedback_d: It is valid to have an if-block without a corresponding else-block (though you cannot have an else-block without a corresponding if-block).
