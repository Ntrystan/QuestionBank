   :feedback_a: These are the values for the pixel at row 30, column 100.
   :feedback_b: These are simply made-up values that may or may not appear in the image.
   :feedback_c: These are the values from the original example (row 45, column 55).
   :feedback_d: Yes, these values are at row 100 and column 30.

   Using the previous ActiveCode example (with annefan.png), select the answer that is closest to the RGB values of the pixel at row 100, column 30?  The values may be off by one or two due to differences in browsers.
