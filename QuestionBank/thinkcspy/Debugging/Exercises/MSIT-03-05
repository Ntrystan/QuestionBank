   :feedback_b: No.  The actual error may have been made be in a previous line.
   :answer_c: The Python interpreter can identify a runtime error in a statement before trying to execute it.

   :answer_d: The Python interpreter must parse a statement before executing it.
   :feedback_d: Yes.  The interpreter parses the statement to determine if it is understandable and unambiguous.
   :answer_e: Typing an extra character in a statement will always result in a syntax error.
