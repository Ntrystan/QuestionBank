   **After you have completed the previous padding problem, create a modified  program that does the following:**
   
   #. Ask the user to enter a word that is 8 letters or fewer.
   #. If the word is exactly 8 characters, print the word without modification.
   #. If the word is shorter than 8 characters:

      * pad it to 8 characters on the left with the "#" character and print the result, AND
      * pad the original word to 8 characters on the RIGHT with the "%"character and print the result.
   
   **NOTE: The IF statement is not permitted.**
