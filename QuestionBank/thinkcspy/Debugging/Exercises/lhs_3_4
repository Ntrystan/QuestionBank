    This program calculates how far an object will fall (in feet) in a given number of seconds. However, it does not produce the correct answer. Find and fix the error:
    
    ~~~~
    g = 32.174;
    
    t = input( "Enter the number of seconds: " )
    d = 1 // 2 * g * t**2
    print( "The brick fell ", d, " feet in ", t, " seconds." )
