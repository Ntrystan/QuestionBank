    This program calculates how far an object will fall (in feet) in a given number of seconds. However, it does not produce the correct answer. Find and fix the error:

    ~~~~
    g = 32.174;

    t = input( "Enter the number of seconds: " )
    d = 1 // 2 * g * t**2
    print( "The brick fell ", d, " feet in ", t, " seconds." )

    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
            dist = 1 / 2 * g * t**2
            self.assertIn('The brick fell  ' + str(dist) + '  feet in  ' + str(t) + '  seconds.', self.getOutput(), "Actual is the correct answer. Expected is your program output")
