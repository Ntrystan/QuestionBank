   **[15 pts] Question 3(b)** This question focuses on numerical calculations with Python. Develop a Python program that takes integers N and K as input and computes the sum of the series:

   ``1/N + 1/(2*N)  + 1/(3*N) + â€¦ + (1/K*N)``


   `Examples:` 

   (1) For N = 10 & K = 5, output is: 137/600 (or 0.2283)

   (2) For N = 8 & K = 12, output is: 86021/221760 (or 0.3879)
