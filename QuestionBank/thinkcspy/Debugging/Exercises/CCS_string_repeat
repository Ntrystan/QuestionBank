   **Write a program that does the following:**

   #. Ask the user to enter a letter or a word.
   #. Ask the user to enter a integer between 0 and 10 indicating how many times the letter or word should be repeated.
   #. Print the user's initial entry the desired number of times, with a space in between each time. 

   **For example, if the user enters "a" then the number 3, the program should print:**

   ::

     a a a 

   **If the user enters "python" and the number 2, the program should print:**
   
   ::
   
       python python

   **If the user enters any letter or word and the number 0, the program should print nothing.**
   
   **NOTE: The IF statement is not permitted.**
