    import turtle
    
    wn = turtle.Screen()    
         
    wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
    
    tess = turtle.Turtle()          
    
    tess.color("hotpink")
    
    tess.pensize(5)
    
    alex = Turtle.Turtle()           
    
    tess.forward(80)
                 
    tess.left(120)
    
    tess.forward(80)
    
    tess.left(120)   
                
    wn.exitonclick()
