   **[15 pts] Question 3(a)** This question focuses on numerical calculations with Python. Develop a Python program that takes integers N and K as input and computes the sum of the series:

   ``N + (N+1) + (N+2) + â€¦ + (N+K)``


   `Examples:` 

   (1) For N = 10 & K = 5, output is: 75

   (2) For N = 8 & K = 12, output is: 182
