   **The "floor" operation takes any decimal input and returns the largest integer that is smaller than the input.**

   For example:
   
   * The floor of 1.2 is 1. 
   * The floor of 1.5 is also 1.
   * The floor of .9999 is 0.

   |
   
   **The "ceil" operation, on the other hand, takes any decimal input and returns the smallest integer larger than the input (i.e. like the "ceiling").**
   
   Therefore:

   * The ceil of 1.9 is 2. 
   * The ceil of 1.5 is also 2. 
   * The ceil of 1.00001 is 2.

   Python has functions to calculate the floor and the ceil but it is not hard to implement simple versions of them yourself, so that is what we will do. **Complete the code below to create a program that asks the user for any decimal input and prints the floor of that input and the ceil of that input.**

   **NOTE: The IF statement is not permitted. Likewise, comparison operators are not permitted. You should do this using just the basic operators you have studied so far.**
