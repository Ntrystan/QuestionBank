    The harmonic mean of two numbers is given by: ``H = 2 / ( 1/X + 1/Y )``. This is sometimes more useful than the more usual average of two numbers. The following program inputs two numbers (as floating point) and writes out both the usual average (the arithmetic mean) and the harmonic mean. The program, however does not work. Find and fix the error(s):

    ~~~~
    x = input("Enter X:")
    y = input("Enter Y:"]

    x = int(x)
    y = int(y)

    aritmeticMean = ( x + y ) // 2
    print("Arithmetic mean: ", aritmeticMean)

    harmonicMean = 2 / ( 1 / x + 1 / y )
    println(""Harmonic   mean: """, harmonicMean)
