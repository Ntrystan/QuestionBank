    Congratulations, you just got a job working for a company that makes 
    widgets. They do all their bookkeeping by hand and make a lot of 
    mistakes. 

    Write a program to help the company compute the final profit/loss each 
    month. Some figures are known and others you'll have to have the 
    program ask the user each month. 

    Profits:
    The company sells blue widgets for $11 and gold widgets for $7.  The 
    number of widgets sold each month changes.

    Expenses:
    Blue widgets cost $5 for the company to make and gold widgets cost 
    $3. 
    There are between 4-7 employees that work each month.
    They each make $400 per month. 

    The output should be the final amount of profit or loss that the company 
    made/lost that month.
