    Create a list of the countries that are in the dictionary ``golds``, and assign
    that list to the variable name ``countries``. Do not hard code this. 
    
    ~~~~   
    golds = {"Italy": 12, "USA": 33, "Brazil": 15, "China": 27, "Spain": 19, "Canada": 22, "Argentina": 8, "England": 29}
    
    # your code here to create the list countries from the golds dictionary.
