    You are keeping track of olympic medals for Italy in the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics!
    At the moment, Italy has 7 gold medals, 8 silver metals, and 6 bronze medals.
    Create a dictionary called ``olympics`` where the keys are the types of medals,
    and the values are the number of that type of medals that Italy has won so far.
