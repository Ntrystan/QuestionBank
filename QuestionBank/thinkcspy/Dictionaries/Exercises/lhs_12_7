    Update the value for "Phelps" in the dictionary ``swimmers`` to include his medals
    from the Rio Olympics by adding 5 to the current value (Phelps will now have 28
    total medals). Do not rewrite the dictionary.
    
    ~~~~   
    swimmers = {'Manuel':4, 'Lochte':12, 'Adrian':7, 'Ledecky':5, 'Dirado':4, 'Phelps':23}
    
    # your code here to make changes to the swimmers dictionary.
