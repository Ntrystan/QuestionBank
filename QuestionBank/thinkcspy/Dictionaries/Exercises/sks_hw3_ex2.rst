    Write a function called ``check_inventory(inventory, low)`` that returns a sorted list of items
    that are below an inventory level that is given by the ``low`` integer parameter. The function
    should work without the ``low`` parameter supplied - in which case, you should assume ``low`` is 5.

    Example: If the inventory is ``{ 'apple':10, 'banana':3 }``, ``check_inventory(inventory)`` 
    will return the list ``['banana']``.  For the same inventory, ``check_inventory(inventory, 15)`` 
    will return the list ``['apple', 'banana']``.

    In the main function, write an example inventory dictionary and call the ``check_inventory`` function.
