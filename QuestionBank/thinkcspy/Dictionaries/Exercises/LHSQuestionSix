    Add the string "hockey" as a key to the dictionary ``sports_periods`` and assign
    it the value of 3. Do not rewrite the entire dictionary.
    
    ~~~~   
    sports_periods = {'baseball': 9, 'basketball': 4, 'soccer': 4, 'cricket': 2}
    
    # your code here to make changes to the sports_periods dictionary.
