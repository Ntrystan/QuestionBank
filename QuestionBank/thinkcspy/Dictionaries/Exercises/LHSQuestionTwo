    Create a dictionary that keeps track of the USA's Olympic medal count. Each key of
    the dictionary should be the type of medal (gold, silver, or bronze) and each key's
    value should be the number of that type of medal the USA's won. Currently, the USA
    has 33 gold medals, 17 silver, and 12 bronze. Create a dictionary saved in the
    variable ``medals`` that reflects this information.
