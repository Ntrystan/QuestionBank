    We have a dictionary of the specific events that Italy has won medals in and the
    number of medals they have won for each event. Assign to the variable ``events``
    a list of the keys from the dictionary ``medal_events``. Do not hard code this.

    ~~~~   
    medal_events = {'Shooting': 7, 'Fencing': 4, 'Judo': 2, 'Swimming': 3, 'Diving': 2}
    
    # your code here to create the list events from the medal_events dictionary.
