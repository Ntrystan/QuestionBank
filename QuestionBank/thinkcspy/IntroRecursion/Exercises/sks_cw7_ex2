    Write the following function described below recursively. You should not have for or while loops
    in your code.

    ``count(str,ch)`` should count the number of times the single character ``ch`` is
    found in the string ``str``.

    Write a main program that takes in a string, a single character, calls the function and 
    prints out the string, character, and the count.

    .. sourcecode:: python

        count("hello","l") # returns 2
        count("hello","z") # returns 0


    ~~~~
    def count(str,ch):
        # write your code here
    
    
    # Make your own test cases here
