   :answer_c: 15
   :answer_d: Nothing.  An error occurs because x cannot be used that many times in assignment statements.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The value of x changes in the second statement.
   :feedback_b: Each statement changes the value of x, so 9 is not the final result.
   :feedback_c: Yes, starting with 12, subtract 3, than add 5, and finally add 1.
   :feedback_d: Remember that variables in Python are different from variables in math in that they (temporarily) hold values, but can be reassigned.
