   Write a program to calculate the amount of candy each child at a party gets. You specify
   the number of children and the total amount of candy, then compute how many pieces each child
   gets, and how many are left over (for the parents to fight over!).
   ~~~~

   # Fill in values for these variables - you choose
   numChildren =
   numPieces =

   # Write a formula to calculate the number of pieces of candy
   # that each child gets. 

   piecesPerChild =

   # Write another formula to calculate the number of pieces of candy
   # that are left over.

   leftoverPieces = 

   # Print out the number of number of pieces per child and the amount left over.
   # Make sure you print out text too so that the user knows what is being printed out.
