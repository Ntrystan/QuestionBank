    Write code to assign the variable ``yb`` to have the same value that variable ``cw`` has. Do not change the first line of code (``cw = "Hello"``). Also, do not "hard code" the result by setting ``yb = "Hello"``. Instead, write code that would work no matter what the current value of ``cw`` is.
    ~~~~
    cw = "Hello"
    yb = 0
