   :answer_a: Nothing - a string and a number can't be added
   :answer_b: "1813"
   :answer_c: 31
   :answer_d: 1318
   :correct: a
   :random:
   :feedback_a: That's right - Python will not add a string and a number
   :feedback_b: No; "18" is a string and 13 is a number - they cannot be concatenated
   :feedback_c: No; "18" is a string and 13 is a number - they cannot be added
   :feedback_d: No, the value is not 1318

   What is the value of x after executing the following code?::

      x = "18" + 13
