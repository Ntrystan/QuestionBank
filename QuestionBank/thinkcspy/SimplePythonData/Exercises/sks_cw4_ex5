   [40 pts] Write a program to simulate the growth and fall of leaves on a tree.  At an initial point, the tree 
   has ``n`` number of leaves.  The tree will lose ``f%`` of its leaves each month (rounded off to the next integer) 
   and will also sprout ``l`` new leaves each month.  Please note that ``f`` is a percentage of leaves on the 
   tree while ``l`` is an integer.  The value of ``f`` should be less than 50% and the value of ``l`` should be no more 
   then 10% of the starting number of leaves ``n``. Your program should request the values of ``n``, ``f``, and ``l`` from 
   the user and calculate the number of months it takes for the tree to have no more than 25% of leaves left.  
   By the end of 5 years, if the tree has more than 25% of its leaves, your program should report the number of leaves
   on the tree.

   Below is a sample run of how the program should proceed:

   ::

     How many leaves does the tree have? 1000
     What is the monthly rate (in percentage) at which leaves fall from this tree? 40
     How many new leaves sprout on this tree each month? 100

     It took 13 months for the tree to lose at least 75% of its leaves.
     The number of leaves left on the tree are 250.

   Below is another sample run of how the program should proceed:

   ::

     How many leaves does the tree have? 5000
     What is the monthly rate (in percentage) at which leaves fall from this tree? 30
     How many new leaves sprout on this tree each month? 500

     Number of leaves on the tree after 5 years is 1666.
