   Write code that first asks for the user's **name** and then asks for the user's **age** in *years*.  After you get those values from the user:

   * Print out a greeting with the user's name in it (e.g. "Hello Frodo!").
   * Print out the user's age in years (e.g. "You are 10 years old.").
   * Print out the user's age in *months*.  (e.g. "Your age in months is 120!")
