   **Homework 5**

   Write a program that calculates the average of n numbers. The program will have n+1 inputs: 

   1. Enter how many numbers you wish to average: this is "n"

   2. Enter a number:

   3. Enter a number:

   4. Enter a number...

   up to n: Enter a number:

   Output should be a statement of the form "The average of your numbers is [average]". Your average must be a float rounded to 2 decimal places (see section 3.5 in Zelle). I have posted some hints on wamap to get you on the right track, ask questions in the wamap forum if you get stuck.
