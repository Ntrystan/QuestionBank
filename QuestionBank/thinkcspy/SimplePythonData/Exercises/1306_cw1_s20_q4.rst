   [20 pts] The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning
   compound interest is given as:

   ``A = P (1 + r / n)^(nt)``

   where,

   `P = principal amount (initial investment)`

   `r = annual nominal interest rate (as a decimal)`

   `n = number of times the interest is compounded per year`

   `t = number of years`

   Write a Python program that prompts a user for the Principal P and the number of years t and prints the final amount. The program assumes  r the interest rate is  5% (0.05), and n, the number of times the interest is compounded per year, to be 12.

   [Hint: Break the computation into sub-computations]
