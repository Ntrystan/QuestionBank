   You are developing a simple ciphering system that takes any message as input and produces 
   a ciphered message as output.  In doing so, you have a write a program that includes two functions.  
   The first is called ``make_dictionary(l1, l2)`` that takes two equal-length lists of single-character strings. 
   It creates and returns a dictionary using the elements of ``l1`` as keys and the elements of ``l2`` as values. 
   The dictionary is then used by a function called ``cipher(s, d)``. The parameter ``s`` is a string and ``d`` is the 
   dictionary created by ``make_dictionary``. Function ``cipher(s, d)`` uses dictionary ``d`` to replace characters 
   in ``s`` that are keys in ``d`` with the corresponding key value. Characters in ``s`` that are not dictionary keys 
   are left unchanged in the ciphered version of the string ``s``. The ciphered string is returned.

   Make sure to add comments to your program. 
   Your program should not use any functions or methods we have not discussed in class.

   An example for the main program that prints `pleise ciphec this ressige` as output would look like the following:
   ::

     list1 = ['r', 'a', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'm']
     list2 = ['c', 'i', 'p', 'h', 'e', 'r']

     cipherdict = make_dictionary(list1, list2)
     message = 'please cipher this message'
     ciphered_message = cipher(message, cipherdict)
     print(ciphered_message)
