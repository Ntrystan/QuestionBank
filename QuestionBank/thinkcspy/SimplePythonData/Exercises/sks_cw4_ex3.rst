   [40 pts] Hailstone Numbers: This sequence takes the name hailstone as the numbers generated bounce up and down. Write a function that will take an integer value as a parameter, the input seed, and will print a hailstone sequence.  

   To generate the sequence, follow these rules:

   a.	If the number is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1 
   b.	If the number is even, divide by two.
   c.	Repeat until you reach number 1.

   Below are some examples of the hailstone sequences generated for some values of n:

   n = 3; 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 

   n = 6; 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 

   n = 7; 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
