   [30 pts] Write a program that will ask the user to provide numbers as input and then find the minimum and the maximum values of the provided numbers.  

   In writing your program, start by asking the user how many numbers they would like to provide in all.  
   Using that value, your program should request the user to enter one value at a time.  
   When the user has provided all the numbers, your program should report the minimum and maximum of all the values entered by the user.
