   The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning
   compound interest is given as:

   ``A = P * (1 + r / n) ** (n * t)``

   where,

   `P = principal amount (initial investment`

   `r = annual nominal interest rate (as a decimal)`

   `n = number of times the interest is compounded per year`

   `t = number of years`

   Write a Python program that assigns the principal amount of 10000 to
   variable `P`, assign to `n` the value 12, and assign to `r` the interest
   rate of 8% (0.08).  Then have the program prompt the user for the number of years,
   `t`, that the money will be compounded for.  Calculate and print the final
   amount after `t` years.
