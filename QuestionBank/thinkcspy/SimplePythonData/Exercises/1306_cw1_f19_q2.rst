   [20 pts] Write a Python program that takes the radius of a circle as input and prints out the perimeter and area 
   of the circle. A user session of the program proceeds as follows:

   ``Program Prompt:`` What is the radius?

   ``User Response:`` 11

   ``Program Prints:`` The perimeter of this circle with a radius of 11 is 69.08.
   
   ``Program Prints:`` The area of this circle with a radius of 11 is 379.94.

   [Hints: You can define Pi to be 3.14. Recall that the input statement reads as a string that can be converted to a float]
