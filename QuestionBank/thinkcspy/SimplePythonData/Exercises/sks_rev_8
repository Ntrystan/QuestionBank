   Below is a sample from a file called ‘studentdata.txt’. It contains one line for each student in an imaginary class. 
   The student’s name is the first thing on each line, followed by some quiz scores. 
   The number of scores might be different for each student.

   Write a program that reads the text file ‘studentdata.txt’ and prints out the names of students who have more than six quiz scores.
