   **[30 points] Question 3**. A palindrome is a string that reads identical forwards and backwards. Examples include abba, abcba,  a1b1b1a, houstonnotsuoh  etc. 
   
   Your task is to write a program that reads an input string, prints that string, and then prints one of the following as appropriate: ``Is a Palindrome`` or ``Not a Palindrome``

   If user response is ``input = racecar``, the above program should print: 

   ::

      racecar 
      Is a Palindrome

   If user response is ``input = hello``, the above program should print: 

   ::

      hello
      Not a Palindrome
