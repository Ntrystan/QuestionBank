     Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter a 
     number of yards, and then calculates the number of miles and
     yards, as well as the number of feet, and then prints the 
     results. See the examples below::

        Example 1:

        Enter a positive number of yards:  3000
        You entered 3000 yards, which is:
        1 miles and 1240 yards
        or
        9000 feet

        Example 2:

        Enter a positive number of yards: 12
        You entered 12 yards, which is:
        0 miles and 12 yards
        or
        36 feet


    When you are finished, write a brief reflection document on what you learned, what was easy/hard, and any other 
    questions or comments you have on the exercise.

    Notes

    There are 3 feet in a yard and 1760 yards in a mile. Your 
    program must declare and use several variables, like for the 
    number of miles and number of feet. You should choose 
    appropriate names based on your reading.

    Write your code in this window. Write your reflection in the Google doc we set up in class.
