   **[40 points] Question 1**. This problem is split into two parts
   
   **PART A:** Write a Python function ``CommonLetters(mystring)`` to take a string ``mystring`` and that prints all letters in the string  "Texas" that also appear in the parameter ``mystring``.

   If user response is ``mystring = arkansas``, the above program should print: 

   ::

      a s

   If user response is ``mystring = Taxes``, the above program should print: 

   ::

      T e x a s
   
   If user response is ``mystring = FLORIDA``, the above program should not print anything. 


   **PART B:** Using the function from Part A, write a program that repeatedly prompts the user to input a string and then prints common letters between the string and "Texas" as described in Part A.
   The program terminates when the user types an empty string.
