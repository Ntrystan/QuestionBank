     Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter a 
     number of hours, and then calculates the number of minutes, as well as the 
     whole number of days, and prints the results nicely. 

     **Notes**

     There are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day. Your 
     program must declare and use several variables. Choose 
     appropriate names based on your reading.

     Write your code in this window.
