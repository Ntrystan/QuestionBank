     Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter a 
     number of quarts, and then calculates the number of gallons and
     remaining quarts, as well as the total number of ounces, and then prints the 
     results. See the examples below::

        Example 1:

        Enter a positive number of quarts:  11
        You entered 11 quarts, which is:
        2 gallons and 3 quarts
        or
        352 ounces

        Example 2:

        Enter a positive number of quarts:  2
        You entered 2 quarts, which is:
        0 gallons and 2 quarts
        or
        64 ounces


    When you are finished, write a brief reflection document on 
      a) what you learned
      b) what was easy
      c) what was difficult
      d) any other questions or comments you have on the exercise

    **Notes**

    There are 32 ounces in a quart and 4 quarts in a gallon. Your 
    program must declare and use several variables, like for the 
    number of gallons and number of ounces. You should choose 
    appropriate names based on your reading.

    Write your code in this window. Write your reflection in the Google doc we set up in class.
