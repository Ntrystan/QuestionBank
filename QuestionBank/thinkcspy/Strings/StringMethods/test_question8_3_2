   :answer_c: n
   :answer_d: Error, you cannot combine all those things together.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, s[1] is y and the index of n is 5, so 5 y characters.  It is important to realize that the index method has precedence over the repetition operator.  Repetition is done last.
   :feedback_b: Close.  5 is not repeated, it is the number of times to repeat.
   :feedback_c: This expression uses the index of n
   :feedback_d: This is fine, the repetition operator used the result of indexing and the index method.
