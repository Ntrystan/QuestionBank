    **In Class #1**
    Start your code with the lines already written below. You will then extract the letters in your first name from strings A and B and print your name as one string. Example output: “Damon”. The actual letters in your name must not appear anywhere in your code. You must extract them from the two strings A & B, then concatenate them into one string and print them out. You will find the string command B.find("D") useful for finding the index of the letter D.

    **Extra Credit**
    Take the string = yourname you created above and print it out backwards. Example: "nomaD"
