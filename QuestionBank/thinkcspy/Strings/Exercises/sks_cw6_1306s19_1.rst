    Two students in another section of  1306 wrote the following functions 
    with the objective of computing a list whose elements are the square of the elements of 
    the original list.  Their program is shown below.

    The results were not entirely as expected. Answer the following as comments underneath the program for each student:
    
    a)	Does John's code complete execution? If so, does it compute the correct result? Explain the reason if any of the answers is NO.

    b)	Write a new function JJsquare that will make John's code work as expected. 

    c)	Does Mary's code complete execution? If so, does it compute the correct result? Explain the reason if any of the answers is NO.

    d)	Write a function MMsquare that will make Mary's code work as expected. 

    {Hint: Retain the basic FOR loop statement when you develop the corrected code  in both cases}

    # Student John
    def Jsquare(lst):
      for i in range(len(lst)):
          lst[i]= lst[i]*lst[i]
      return lst

    # Student Mary
    def Msquare(lst):
       for item in lst:
          lst[item]= lst[item]*lst[item]
       return lst

    # The testing code for the functions is as follows

    mylist = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    mynewlist = Jsquare(mylist)  # Or whatever is the function name
    print(mylist) 			# should print original list
    print(mynewlist)			# should print squares list
