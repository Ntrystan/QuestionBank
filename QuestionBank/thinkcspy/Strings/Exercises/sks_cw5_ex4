    A palindrome is a string that reads identical forwards and backwards. Examples include 'abba', 'abcba',  
    'houstonnotsuoh', etc. 

    You will write a function that reads an input string and returns ``True`` if it is a palindrome and ``False`` if it is not. 
    (Hint: traverse the string backwards and forwards in a for loop to check if the characters match)
