    Write a program that asks user to enter a sentence and then capitalizes the first letter of each word in the line
    as in a title header of a newspaper. The first word is always capitalized. Special words are
    not capitalized - such as 'a', 'the', etc.

    A list ``specialWords`` is in the code below which contains all the special words that are **not**
    to be capitalized (unless it is the first word of the title).

    The function should **return** a string of the capitalized line.

    Example inputs:

    ::

      The Story of the Amazing Rat
      A Battle That Will Never Be Forgotten
      In the Beginning of Time

    ~~~~
    import string
    
    # the list of special words - you can use this as a global variable
    # within your function
    specialWords = ['a', 'an', 'the', 'at', 'by', 'for', 'in', 
                   'of', 'on', 'to', 'up', 'and', 'as', 
                   'but', 'or', 'nor']
