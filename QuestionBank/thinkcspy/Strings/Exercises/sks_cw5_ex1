    Write a function ``capTitle(line)`` that capitalizes the first letter of each word in the line
    as in a title header of a newspaper. The first word is always capitalized. Special words are
    not capitalized - such as 'a', 'the', etc.
    
    A list ``specialWords`` is in the code below which contains all the special words that are **not**
    to be capitalized (unless it is the first word of the title).
    
    The function should **return** a string of the capitalized line.
    
    Example titles:
    
    ::
    
      The Story of the Amazing Rat
      A Battle That Will Never Be Forgotten
      In the Beginning of Time

    # within your function
    specialWords = ['a', 'an', 'the', 'at', 'by', 'for', 'in', 
                   'of', 'on', 'to', 'up', 'and', 'as', 
                   'but', 'or', 'nor']
    
    # define the capTitle() function here
    
    # some test cases
    print(capTitle("the story of the amazing rat"))
