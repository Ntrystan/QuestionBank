    A palindrome is a string that reads identical forwards and backwards. Examples include 'abba', 'abcba',  
    'houstonnotsuoh', etc. 

    You will write a Python function that takes a string as a parameter and returns ``True`` if it is a palindrome and ``False`` if it is not. 
    (Hint: traverse the string backwards and forwards in a for loop to check if the characters match). Then write a program that calls this function to check if the following are palindromes:  'aabbaa'  , 'a123321a', 'xyzxyzxyz' , 'palindrome'.
    Expected output will be of the form:

    aabbaa is a palindrome

    a123321a is a palindrome

    etc.
