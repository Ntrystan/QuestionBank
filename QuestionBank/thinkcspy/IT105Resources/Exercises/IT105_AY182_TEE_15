  Complete the function below that flips a coin. The function should **return** a ``1`` for heads and a ``2`` for tails. The result of each call **must** be a **random** ``1`` or ``2``. 
  
  For example:
  
  ::
  
    flip() # returns 1
    flip() # returns 1
    flip() # returns 2
    flip() # returns 1
  
  **Note:** You can delete the ``pass`` line. Or you can leave it. It doesn't do anything. ``pass`` is just there so that the function bodies aren't empty since that would cause a syntax error.
