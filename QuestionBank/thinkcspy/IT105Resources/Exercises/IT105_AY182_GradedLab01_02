   Write a function ``drawEqTriangle(turtle, length)`` that will take a turtle and 
   a length and draw an equilateral triangle. The function will use the ``areaOfEqTriangle(side)``
   function from problem 1 to calculate and write the area at a distance of 10 below the left most corner.
   The function has no ``return``. The function does not modify the Screen object 
   in which the turtle draws.

   Example: 

   ::     
      
      ### bob is a properly defined Turtle object
      ### The background color for the Screen object was changed to "lightblue"
      drawEqTriangle(bob,120)
