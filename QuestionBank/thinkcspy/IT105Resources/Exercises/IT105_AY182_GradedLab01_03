   Write a function ``drawTriangles(a,b,c,color)`` that will create a Turtle and Screen object
   and draw three equilateral triangles with the area written in the triangle. 
   The function has no ``return``.

   The three equilateral triangles will have the bottom left corners at **(0,100)** with side length a, 
   **(0, -100)** with side length b, and **(-100,0)** with side length c. The turtle will return to origin **(0,0)** 
   and face east. The screen background will be changed to color. The first image shows the coordinates 
   where triangles are drawn.

   **Use The Function from Question 1 and 2 Here.** Note you can call
   ``areaOfEqTriangle(side)`` and ``drawEqTriangle(turtle, side)`` in 
   this code block.
