   **This is your chance to increase your grade on graded lab 1. No late submissions will be accepted.**

   ::

      1. If you earned more than 14 points on question 3, you can earn up to 11 points or  a maximum of 110 total points for the lab, which ever is lower.
      2. Else you can replace your question 3 grade with up to  25.
      

   Write a function ``drawTriangles(a,b,c,color)`` that will create a Turtle and Screen object
   and draw three equilateral triangles with the area written in the triangle. 
   The function has no ``return``.

   The three equilateral triangles will have the bottom left corners at **(0,100)** with side length a, 
   **(0, -100)** with side length b, and **(-100,0)** with side length c. The turtle will return to origin **(0,0)** 
   and face east. The screen background will be changed to color. The first image shows the coordinates 
   where triangles are drawn.

   Example function call:

      drawTriangles(50,45,40,"lightblue")

   **Use the prewritten functions. Make sure you put your code below them.** You must use
   ``areaOfEqTriangle(side)`` and ``drawEqTriangle(turtle, side)`` to solve the problem and get full credit. 

 
   ~~~~
   ###Put your code below both function.
   import math
   import turtle
   def areaOfEqTriangle(side):
   #This function has one parameter side (length of one sides of a equilateral triangle).
   #It calculates the area and returns the area. If side is less than or equal to zero it returns -1.
      if side <= 0:
         area = -1
      else:
         area = math.sqrt(3)/4*side**2
      return area

   def drawEqTriangle(t, length):
   #This function has two parameters t (turtle object) and length (length of the side of an equilateral triangle). 
   # There is no return. The function prints the triangle to the screen with the length under it.
      t.fd(length)
      t.lt(120)
      t.fd(length)
      t.lt(120)
      t.fd(length)
      t.lt(120)
      t.rt(90)
      t.pu()
      t.fd(10)
      t.lt(90)
      t.write(areaOfEqTriangle(length))
      t.lt(90)
      t.fd(10)
      t.rt(90)
      t.pd()
   
   
   ###Put your code below this point.

   ### Name:

   ### define the drawTriangles(a,b,c,color) function here

   ### drawTriangles(50,45,40,"lightblue") #uncomment to test
