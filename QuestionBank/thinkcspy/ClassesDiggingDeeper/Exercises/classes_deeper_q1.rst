   We can represent a rectangle by knowing three things: the location of its lower left corner, its width, and its height.
   Create a class definition for a Rectangle class using this idea.  To create a Rectangle object at location (4,5) with width 6
   and height 5, we would do the following::

       r = Rectangle(Point(4, 5), 6, 5)
