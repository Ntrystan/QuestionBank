   31. What does the following code do? Assume img1 and img2 are two images that are the same size. You may run the function.::

      def do_something(img1, img2):
          w = img1.getWidth()
          h = img1.getHeight()
          new_img = img1.clone()
          for y in range(0, int(h/2)):
              for x in range(0, w):
                  p = img1.getPixel(x, y)
                  new_img.setPixel(x, y, p)
          for y in range(int(h/2), h):
              for x in range(0, w):
                  p = img2.getPixel(x, y)
                  new_img.setPixel(x, y, p)
          return new_img
