    Write a Python function ``isPrime(number)`` that determines if the number given as an 
    argument is prime or not. The function will return a Boolean ``True`` or ``False``. Next,
    write a function ``FindPrimes(P)``, that takes a parameter ``P`` as argument and returns 
    the number of prime numbers between 1 and P. Test for a maximum value of P = 1000. 

    Hint: The function ``FindPrimes(P)`` can be written with a for loop.
