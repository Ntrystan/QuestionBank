    Johnathan is an elementary school student. Johnathan got a homework where the teacher 
    has given Johnathan two numbers, ``Number1`` and ``Number2`` and asked Johnathan to 
    find the sum of all the numbers in between ``Number1`` and ``Number2`` (inclusive).  The
    numbers to be included for computing the sum follow a pattern where Johnathan has to 
    skip incremental amount of numbers until ``Number2``. That is, take first number, then take 
    the 3rd number, then take the 6th number, then take 10th number, and so on until Johnathan 
    reaches the ``Number2``. Johnathan knows that you are learning programming and you can help 
    him solve this sequence using your programming skills. Write a program that will help 
    Johnathan to find the sum of this sequence.

    Input Constraints:
    0 <= Number1 < Number2 <= 200
    Input Format: 
    Two lines with one integer each. Integer in line two will always be greater than the 
    integer in line one.
    Output Format: 
    Single integer which will be the num of the sequence.


    Example of the program execution:
    ::

        First Number: 100
        Second Number: 110
        Number to sum is: 100
        Number to sum is: 101
        Number to sum is: 103
        Number to sum is: 106
        Number to sum is: 110
        Summation: 520
