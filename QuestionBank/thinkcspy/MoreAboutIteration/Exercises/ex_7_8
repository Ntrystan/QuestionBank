   Write a function ``print_triangular_numbers(n)`` that prints out the first
   n triangular numbers. A call to ``print_triangular_numbers(5)`` would
   produce the following output::

       1       1
       2       3
       3       6
       4       10
       5       15

   (*hint: use a web search to find out what a triangular number is.*)
