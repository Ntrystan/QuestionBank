    Each time Kevin re-reads his Python book (which happens every month), he learns 10%
    of whatever material he didn’t know before. He needs to score at least 95% on his
    final exam to get an A in the class. When Kevin started, he knew nothing about Python.
    Write a function ``getLearningTime(rate, target)`` that simulates Kevin’s learning
    progress and returns the number of months it will take him to get ready for the exam.

                total += (1 - total) * rate
