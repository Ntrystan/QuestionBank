      :feedback_a: Python gives number the value of items in the list, one at a time, in order (from left to right).  number gets a new value each time the loop repeats.
      :feedback_b: Yes, Python will process the items from left to right so the first time the value of number is 5 and the second time it is 4.
      :feedback_c: Python gives number the value of items in the list, one at a time, in order.  number gets a new value each time the loop repeats.
      :feedback_d: Python gives number the value of items in the list, one at a time, in order (from left to right).  number gets a new value each time the loop repeats.
