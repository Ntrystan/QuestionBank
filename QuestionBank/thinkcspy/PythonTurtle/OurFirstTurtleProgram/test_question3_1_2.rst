   :answer_a: This is simply for clarity.  It would also work to just type "Turtle()" instead of "turtle.Turtle()".
   :answer_b: The period (.) is what tells Python that we want to invoke a new object.
   :answer_c: The first "turtle" (before the period) tells Python that we are referring to the turtle module, which is where the object "Turtle" is found.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: We must specify the name of the module where Python can find the Turtle object.
   :feedback_b: The period separates the module name from the object name.  The parentheses at the end are what tell Python to invoke a new object.
   :feedback_c: Yes, the Turtle type is defined in the module turtle.  Remember that Python is case sensitive and Turtle is different from turtle.

   Why do we type ``turtle.Turtle()`` to get a new Turtle object?
