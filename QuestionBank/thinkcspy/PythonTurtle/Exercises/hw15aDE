   **Homework 15**
  
    A window opens with a color-filled square inside of it, similar to the dice drawing. A text box below the square reads "Click anywhere inside the square". Anywhere the user clicks, a white dot appears. Subsequently, every time the user clicks inside the square the old dot disappears and a new dot is drawn. Repeat this pattern until the user clicks outside the square, at which point the program terminates.
