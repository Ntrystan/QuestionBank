   Complete the following program to use a turtle to draw a
   rectangle with vertical lines at every 10 units. The given
   code draws the initial rectangle. Your job is to add code
   that draws vertical lines 10 units apart; for full credit
   use a loop. For an additional challenge (but no additional
   credit) use two turtles - one to draw horizontal lines and
   one to draw vertical lines.
