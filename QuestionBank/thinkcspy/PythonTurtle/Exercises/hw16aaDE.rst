   **Homework 16 part a**
  
    Modify your Two Dice program so that user starts with two blank faces and a text box reading “Click to roll the dice”. When user clicks anywhere in the window, screen displays a random roll of the dice, for example a 3 and a 6. Text box changes to "Roll again". Every time the user clicks in the window, the dice display a new random roll. After five (5) rolls the text box changes to "Click anywhere to exit." One last click terminates the program.
    
    There will be partial credit grading on this assignment so try to get as many pieces of the code to run as you can.
