   :feedback_a: Yes, the code prints integers 1 through 5 on the same line separated by spaces
   :feedback_b: No, num is the loop variable and receives the values in the list
   :feedback_c: No - it prints spaces but also integers 1 through 5
   :feedback_d: No - end is a keyword used to determine what to print at the end of the print statement

   1. What does the following code print?::

      for num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
          print(num, end = ' ')
