    Write a program to draw the (turtle) graph for a 4th degree polynomial function
    given its coefficients as variables a3, a2, a1, a0. Get your output as close to
    these examples (https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-collegealgebra/chapter/graphs-of-polynomial-functions/).
    Make sure you draw the x-axis and y-axis with numbers. Use turtle functions listed here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
