    Use a for loop to make an equilateral triangle.   Each turn will be 120
    degrees because there are 3 turns and 360 / 3 = 120.  

    Move to another place on the screen with the pen up.  

    This time make a regular pentagon (5 sides).  Each side should be a 
    different color.  Use a list of 5 colors to control the loop.  

    Your turns should be 72 degrees because there are 5 turns and 
    360 / 5 = 72.
