   [30 pts] Consider the following program::

   
      quiz1 = int(input('Enter Quiz 1 grade: '))
      quiz2 = int(input('Enter Quiz 2 grade: '))
      midterm = int(input('Enter Midterm grade: '))
      final = int(input('Enter Final grade: '))
      quiz_average = quiz1 + quiz2 / 2
      total = quiz_average*0.25 + mid_term*0.25 + final*0.5
      print('Your class grade is:', "total")

   a)	What seems to be the purpose of the above program? `Please answer as comment at the beginning of the program.`

   b)	Can you discover any errors? List any errors you discover. State if they are a syntax, runtime, or logic error.  `Please answer as comment immediately below the line where you discover an error.`

   c)	Correct any errors you discover. Run the program and state the result for input scores: quiz 1 = 100, quiz2 = 60,  mid_term= 90, final = 70.  Verify by hand calculation if the result is correct.
