    In the scenario of question 1 from Classwork-2, all quizzes and exams were scored out of a 100. Suppose, the quizzes are
    scored out of 50 each, and mid term and final are still scored out of 100. Also, the total weights
    should now be: quizzes 30%, mid term 30% and final 40%. Modify the program to reflect this
    change?
