   **Homework 14 part a**
  
    Draw 6 rectangles in a graphics window. Make the rectangles a different color from the background. The tops of your rectangles should conform to the linear function y=x, creating a diagonal pattern up-and-to-the-right. In order to receive full credit you must use a for loop, a clone command, and a .move(dx,dy) command. Do not simply paste six different rectangles in six different places.
