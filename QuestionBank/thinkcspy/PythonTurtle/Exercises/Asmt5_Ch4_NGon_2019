    Ask the user how many sides he/she would like for his her polygon.
    Then draw the appropriate regular polygon.  

    For example, if the user says 8 sides, draw a regular octagon. 

    If he/she says 5 sides, draw a regular pentagon.  

    Remember to use the   INT  function when you input a number.  See below.  

    nSides = int ( input ("How many sides for your polygon") )
