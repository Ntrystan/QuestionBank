   A seasick pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes another random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc.  A social science student records the angle of each turn before the next 100 steps are taken.  Her experimental data is ``160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86``. (Positive angles are counter-clockwise.)  Use a turtle to draw the path taken by our seasick friend.  After the pirate is done walking, print the current heading.
