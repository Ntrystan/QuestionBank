   **[30 pts] Question 3** 

   In this question, you will experimentally verify the sensitivity of using a precise Pi to the accuracy of computing area. You need to perform the following activities with Python program:
   

   a) Compute the area of a circle with radius 10 using Pi from the Python Math Library. Assign the area to a variable, say realA.
   
   b) Now compute the area of the circle using the Pi value with precision 1,2, and 3 points after the decimal place. (i.e., Pi = 3.1, 3.14 & 3.141).  Then Print the percentage difference between eacj of the areas calculated using each of these values of Pi and realA.
