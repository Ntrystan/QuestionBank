    Do the Sine Lab at https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/Labs/sinlab.html
    that is referenced in **"Unit 5.4 The random module"**.

    Write your final code to generate a **nice looking sine wave** in the following code box below. The
    sine wave should at least go through angles 0 to 360, but it **may** do more oscillations if you desire.
    The sine wave should not be so "small" that it looks like a line. It should look like the graph
    at the top of the Sine Lab where it describes **"What is the sine function?"**

    **HINT**: *yourScreenName*.setworldcoordintes(llx,lly,urx,ury) can be used to change the coordinate
    system of the canvas so that the left hand side of the canvas is x = 0 and the y values can
    be between -2 and 2. See the **"Making the Plot Better"** for ideas on this.
