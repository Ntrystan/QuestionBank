   :feedback_a: While you might want to use the math module for other numerical computations in your program, it does not contain functions that are likely to help you simulate a dice roll.
   :feedback_b: You would likely call the function random.randrange.
   :feedback_c: The turtle module, while producing interesting graphics, is unlikely to help you here.
   :feedback_d: Python does not have a game module.
