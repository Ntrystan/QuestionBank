    Asmt 12.  GUESS THE DIE ROLL 

    1)  Use the input keyword to ask the user to guess the 
    roll of a die.  Save the result in a variable called   dieGuess
    
    See your written notes ion Input in your notebook 
    or Mini Lesson 2.8 online
    
    2) Use the random number features to assign a random number
    from 1 to 6 to a variable called   die

    See your written notes from last class or Lesson 7.4 online 
    to do Random Numbers and If / Else 

    3) Compare  die and dieGuess  using an   if  statement to see
    if they are equal.   If they are equal, print a message telling 
    the user that she/he made a good guess.  

    4) Otherwise (else) print a statement wishing the user better
    luck next time.
