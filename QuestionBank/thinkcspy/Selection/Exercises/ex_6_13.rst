   Implement the calculator for the date of Easter.
   
   The following algorithm computes the date for Easter Sunday for any year between 1900 to 2099.
   
   Ask the user to enter a year.
   Compute the following:
   
   
   
       1. a = year % 19
       #. b = year % 4
       #. c = year % 7
       #. d = (19 * a + 24) % 30
       #. e = (2 * b + 4 * c + 6 * d + 5) % 7
       #. dateofeaster = 22 + d + e
   
   
   Special note: The algorithm can give a date in April.  Also, if the year is one of four special
   years (1954, 1981, 2049, or 2076) then subtract 7 from the date.
   
   Your program should print an error message if the user provides a date that is out of range.
