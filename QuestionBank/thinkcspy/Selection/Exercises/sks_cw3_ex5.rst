   [40 pts] A fruit company sells oranges for 32 cents a pound plus $7.50 per order for shipping.  If an order is 100 pounds or more, then the shipping cost is reduced to $1.50 for the entire order.  
   Write a program that will ask the user for the number of pounds of oranges and then print the cost of the order. Your program must include the functions ``findsaleprice`` and ``findshippingcost`` 
   as indicated below:

   ~~~~
   # This function takes the quantity of oranges ordered in pounds 
   # and the per pound price as parameters and returns the total 
   # price for the order.

   def findsaleprice(amount, price):

   # This function takes the quantity of oranges ordered in pounds 
   # as parameter and returns the total shipping cost.

   def findshippingcost(amount):

   # Write program here to ask user for number of pounds of oranges to order 
   # and print the total cost of the order including shipping.
