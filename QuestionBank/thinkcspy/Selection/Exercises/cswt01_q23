      def decide(temp, weather):
          if temp > 90:
              if weather == "calm":
                  action = "hike"
              elif weather == "stormy":
                  action = "movie"
              else:
                  action = "do nothing"
          else:
              if weather == "calm":
                  action = "golf"
              else:
                  action = "book"
          return action
