   **Homework 10 part c**

    Write a program called ``headstails.py``. It should include a function ``flip()`` that simulates a single flip of a coin: it randomly prints either Heads or Tails. Accomplish this by choosing 0 or 1 arbitrarily with random.randrange(2), and use an if-else statement to print Heads when the result is 0, Tails when it's 1. Review section 5.4 on the Random Module.
    Now add a function ``main()`` to your program that calls flip() 10 times to test it, so main() prints out a random sequence of 10 Heads and Tails every time you invoke it.
