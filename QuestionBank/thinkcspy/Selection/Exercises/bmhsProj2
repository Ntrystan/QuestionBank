    Area Calculator app   

    **Remember to comment EVERY LINE of code and include the output 
    (for both types of shapes) as a multi line comment and the top of your 
    code before submitting **

     Python is especially useful for doing math and can be used to 
    automate many calculations. In this project, you'll create a calculator 
    than can compute the area of a given shape, as selected by the user. 
    
    The calculator will be able to determine the area of the following 
    shapes:
    - Circle
    - Triangle

    The program should do the following:
    - Prompt the user to select a shape
    - Depending on the shape the user selects, calculate the area of that 
      shape
    - Print the area of that shape to the user

    ********Let's begin!

    Area Calculator

    1.Remember, it's helpful to let other developers know what your 
    program does.Begin by including a multi-line comment that describes 
    what your program will do. You can use the 
    instructions above to help you write the comment.

    Hint
 
    """
    This program does the following...
    but i agree to fail if i don't follow
    the instructions as this is only a hint
    Author: Your name here
    """

    2.This area calculator requires the use of Python code that isn't built-in 
    or readily available to us. To gain access to the Python code, we need 
    to import the code specifically. Since we will calculate the area of a 
    circle, we will need to use the value pi.Somewhere after your multi-line 
    comment, type the following line of code:
    from math import pi

    3.You'll also need access to some more Python code that will be used 
    to simulate a thinking calculator. On the next line, type:
    from time import sleep

    4.When the program starts, we'll print the date and time to the user. 
    Unfortunately, the date and time aren't already built-in to Python, but 
    that's okay, we can import them as well. On the next line, type:
    from datetime import datetime

    5.Great! We've imported the code we'll need, and now we need to 
    make use of it.Next, as described in this exercise, use the 
    datetime.now() function to retrieve the current date and time. Store the 
    result into a variable called now.We'll use the other code we imported 
    later in this project.

    Hint
     now = datetime.now()

    6.Print a message to the user to let them know the calculator is 
    starting up.HintFeel free to print your own message.
    print ("Starting the calculator...")

    7.Now let's print out the current month, day, year, hour, and minute (in 
    that order). Use string formatting to print out that information in the 
    following format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM

    Hint
     print ("Current time: %s/%s/%s %s:%s" % (now.month, now.day, 
     now.year, now.hour, now.minute))

    8.It's time to use some more of the code that you imported earlier.On 
    the next line, ask the program to sleep for 1 second. To "sleep" a 
    program means to delay it from processing the next line of code by an 
    amount of time that you specify.Note: Sleeping a program is not 
    common practice. We are using it in this project to practice using 
    imported code and to simulate a thinking calculator.

    Hint
     sleep(1)

    9.Remember when your math teacher always nagged you about 
    including the correct units? We're going to do that in this step. This will 
    help our users get the most out of the calculator. Store the following 
    string into a string variable that says " Hint: Don't forget to include the 
    correct units! \nExiting"
    
    10.We need to find out what shape to calculate the area of, so let's ask 
    the user.Prompt the user for input with the following: Enter C for Circle 
    or T for Triangle:Store their input into a variable called option.

    Hint
     option = input("Enter C for Circle or T for Triangle: ")

    11.What if a user enters a character that is lowercase? Let's prepare 
    for that by instantly making any character that the user inputs 
     uppercase. The .upper() function that you learned here will help!

    Hint
     option = option.upper()

    12.Great! Now it's time to calculate the area of the shape that the user 
    specifies.Use an if statement that will check if the option the user 
    entered is C (for circle).

    Hint
     if option == 'C':

    13.Inside of the if statement, prompt the user to input the radius. Store 
    their input into a variable called radius. 

     Hint
      if option == 'C':
      radius = input("Enter radius: ")
      
    Note: Want to code like a professional? When indenting, make sure 
      to use 4 spaces, as specified by the Python documentation. 

    14.Using raw_input alone will store the user's input as a string. Since 
    we are going to do some math (calculations) with the user's input, we 
    need numbers, not strings.Wrap the raw_input("Enter radius: ")part of 
    your code with float(). This will make sure we are storing the user's 
    input as a floating point number. We'll then be able to perform 
    calculations with their input.

     Hint
      if option == 'C':
      radius = float(input("Enter radius: "))

    15.While staying inside the if statement, calculate the area of a circle 
    on the next line. To do so, you'll need the value of pi, which we already 
    imported earlier and can be accessed by simply typing pi. You can use 
    exponentiation to square the radius. Finally, store the result in a 
    variable called area.

    Hint
     if option == 'C':
     radius = float(input("Enter radius: "))
     area = pi * radius**2

    16.Again, inside the if statement, print The pie is baking... on the next 
    line.

    Hint
     if option == 'C':
     radius = float(input("Enter radius: "))
     area = pi * radius**2
     print ("The pie is baking...")

     17.Next, simulate a thinking calculator by sleeping the program for 1 
     second.

      Hint
       if option == 'C':
       radius = float(input("Enter radius: "))
       area = pi * radius**2
       print ("The pie is baking...")
       sleep(1)

    18.Finally, on the next line, print the area along with the hint using 
    string formatting. Format the area to print only two decimal places and 
    print the hint on a new line. See if you can do this all in one line of 
    code.

     Hint
      if option == 'C':
      radius = float(input("Enter radius: "))
      area = pi * radius**2  
      print ("The pie is baking...")
      sleep(1) 
       print ("Area: %.2f. \n%s" % (area, hint))

    19.Great! You've completed the part of the program that handles the 
    calculation for the area of a circle. Now it's time to move on to the next 
    shape: the triangle.Add a corresponding elif statement to your if 
    statement. The elif statement should check if the option the user 
    entered is T (for triangle).

     Hint - NOTE: this is repeated code shortened to show the elif
      if option == 'C':
        # ...
      elif option == 'T':

    20.The sequence in the elif block will be similar to the sequence of 
    code used in calculating the area of the circle.To calculate the area of 
    a triangle, first ask the user to enter the base of the triangle. Store the 
    user's input in a variable called base. Convert the user's input from a 
    String to a number by using the float()command.

     Hint 
      Use the hint from Step 14 to help you.

    21.The height of the triangle is also needed to calculate its area. Ask 
    the user to input the height of the triangle and store the input in a 
    variable called height.

     Hint 
      Use the hints from Steps 14 and 20 to help you.22.Next, calculate the 
      area and store it in a variable called area.

     Hint
      elif option == 'T':
        base = float(input("Enter base: "))
        height = float(input("Enter height: "))
        area = (0.5)*base*height

    23.Next, print the message Uni Bi Tri...to the user. On the next line, 
    sleep the program for 1 second.

     Hint
      elif option == 'T':
        base = float(input("Enter base: "))
        height = float(input("Enter height: "))
        area = (0.5)*base*height
        print ("Uni Bi Tri...")
        sleep(1)

    24.Finally, print the area along with the hint using string formatting. 
    Format the area to print only two decimal places and print the hint on a 
    new line.HintUse the hint from Step 18 to help you.25.Fantastic! The 
    user can now specify C for circle or T for triangle. But what if the user 
    enters garbage?Add an else block to handle this possible case.

     Hint
      if option=='C':
        # ...
      elif option=='T':
        # ...
       else:

    26.Inside of the else block, print a message to the user informing them 
    that they entered garbage and that the program will exit.

     Hint
      else:
        print ("Error! Invalid shape selector specified. Exiting.")

    27.Perfect! Now we're ready to try the program out.First, click Run. 
    You should see the program run in the terminal. It should print the 
    welcome message, the time, and then prompt you for input. Go ahead 
    and try the calculator out and see if it works!

    28.Self-check your project by confirming the following two examples:
    For a circle: inputting 23.3 for the radius outputs 1705.54.
    For a triangle: inputting 33 as the base and 11 as the height outputs 
    181.50.

    Congratulations, you have a working area calculator! As an extension, 
    see if you can add functionality to calculate the area of other shapes, 
    like a square, or a rectangle, or other shapes. Happy coding!
