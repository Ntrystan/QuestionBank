   **Homework 10 part b**

    Your program (again, not a function) will ask the user for a number from 1 to 100. Then your program will calculate the multiple of 5 in the range 1 to 100 nearest to that number. There will be three possible outputs:

   1)  The nearest multiple of 5 is x, or

   2)  The number you entered already is a multiple of 5, or

   3)  You did not pick a number from 1 to 100. Go back and try again.

    You will have to use some **if-else** decision structures along with the math operation x%5. Play around with plugging in different numbers for x, then take x%5 to get a feel for what it does. Here are example inputs and outputs:

   input: 21 output: 20

   input: 25 output: 25 is already a multiple of 5

   input: 1 output: 5 (numbers 1,2,3,4 are closest to 5)

   input: 0 output: You did not pick a number from 1 to 100. Go back and try again (program closes down).

    Make certain your program runs in RUNESTONE
