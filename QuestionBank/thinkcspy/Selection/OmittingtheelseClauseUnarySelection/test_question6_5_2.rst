   :answer_b: Yes
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Every else-block must have exactly one corresponding if-block.  If you want to chain if-else statements together, you must use the else if construct, described in the chained conditionals section.
   :feedback_b: This will cause an error because the second else-block is not attached to a corresponding if-block.

     else:
