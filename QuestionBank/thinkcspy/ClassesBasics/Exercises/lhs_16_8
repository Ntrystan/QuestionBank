    Create a class called ``Animal`` that has two instance variables: ``arms`` and ``legs``.
    Create a class method called ``limbs`` that, when called, returns the total number of
    limbs the animal has. To the variable name ``spider``, assign an instance of ``Animal``
    that has 4 arms and 4 legs. Call the ``limbs`` method on ``spider`` and save the
    result to the variable name ``spidlimbs``.
