    Create a class called ``math_op`` with one instance variable and a method. The
    instance variable should be ``numb``. The method should be called ``squared`` and
    return the instance variable squared. Create an instance of this class with an
    initial number of 8. Assign to the variable ``output`` the value of the square of the ``numb`` without
    hardcoding. Call the method so that the value which is returned is 64.
