    Create a class called ``Apple`` that contains one instance variable, quantity.
    Write a class method called ``increase`` that increases the quantity by 1
    each time it is run. Assign to the variable tester, an instance of ``Apple``
    that has an initial quantity of 4. Assign to the variable ``initial_quantity``
    the value of tester's quantity without hardcoding. Call the method four times.
