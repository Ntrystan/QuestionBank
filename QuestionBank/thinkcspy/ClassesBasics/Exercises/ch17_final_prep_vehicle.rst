    Define a class "Vehicle".  It must have the following attributes: color, model, number_of_wheels, number_of_doors.  Initialize the attributes via the constructor, with four parameters.

    After your definition, the following code should work:
    
    veh = Vehicle("Blue", "Tacoma", 4, 4)

    print(veh.color)

    print(veh.model)

    print(veh.number_of_wheels)

    print(veh.number_of_doors)
