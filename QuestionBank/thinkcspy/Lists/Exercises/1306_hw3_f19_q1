    **[40 points] Question 1.**  Write a function ``CoolPara``, that takes a string parameter, which is expected to be a pargraph from a book. The function will compute and print the following:


    a.	The number of words in the input paragraph. Assume words are separated by spaces.
    b.	The number of words that include a "rare" letter defined as j,x,q, or z. 
    c.	The number of words that are 8 letters or longer.

    The function returns True if the number of words > 10,  at least 10% of the words have "rare" letters in them, and at least 10% of the words are 8 letters or longer. False otherwise

    [Hints: Only use ``split()`` and ``len()`` methods/functions. You may consider any characters other than blanks, including punctuation and numbers, as parts of words]

    **Example Input:**

    In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, no yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat; it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. 
   
    **Example Output:**

    52 words in the input paragraph

    1 word with a rare character

    2 words that have 8 letters or more
    
    FALSE

    def CoolPara(words):
        # your code here


    # DO NOT CHANGE CODE BELOW 
    
    print(CoolPara(input("Enter: ")))
