    **[30 points] Question 3.** In this question you will practice passing lists as parameters to a function. Your goal is to write a function definition for:  ``SmartSquare (inlist, inplace)`` . Parameter inlist is a list of integers and the parameter inplace is a boolean with a value True or False. The function proceeds as follows:

    If inplace is True, ``SmartSquare`` replaces the numbers in the parameter inlist in with their squares. (The list in the calling program will change). The function also returns a list with squares of the numbers of the original list.

    If inplace is False, ``SmartSquare`` returns a list containing the squares of values of the numbers in inlist. The inlist itself is not changed.

    Here are some sample runs:

    ::

        mylist = [2 , 11, 7]
        
        sqlist = SmartSquare(mylist, True)
        
        print(mylist,sqlist)

    will print 

    ::

        [4, 121, 49] [4, 121, 49]

    Another run:
    ::

        mylist = [2 , 11, 7]
        
        sqlist = SmartSquare(mylist,False)
        
        print(mylist,sqlist)

    will print

    ::

        [2, 11, 7] [4, 121, 49]

    # DO NOT CHANGE CODE BELOW 
    mylist = [] 
    n = int(input("Enter number of elements in the List : ")) 
    for i in range(0, n): 
       num = int(input("Num "+str(i+1))) 
       mylist.append(num)  

    print(mylist, SmartSquare(mylist,True))
    print(mylist, SmartSquare(mylist,False))
