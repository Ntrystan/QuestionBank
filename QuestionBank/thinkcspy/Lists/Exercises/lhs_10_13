    Write a function ``rotate(lst, num)`` that takes a list referred to by ``lst``, 
    removes the first element and appends it to the end of the list. This process is
    repeated ``num`` times. The function should accomplish this solely by rearranging
    elements of the list: **do not** allocate any additional lists.
