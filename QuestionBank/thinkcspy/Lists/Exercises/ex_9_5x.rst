   Write a Python function that will take a list of 100 integers 
   between 0 and 1000 and return the maximum value. (Note: there is a builtin
   function named max but pretend you cannot use it.) Write additional code
   to create a list of 100 random integers and use your function to find the
   maximum value.

   import random

   def findmax(numbers):
       '''Returns the maximum number in numbers; numbers is a list of ints'''
       #Add your code here to find the maximum value
       #Set a variable to zero - this will hold the max value
       #For each number in numbers
           #If the number is greater than the current max value
               #Set the current max value to the number
       #Don't forget to return the max value


   #Add your code here to create a list of random numbers
   #Start with an empty list
   #Loop 1000 times - use a for loop
       #Generate a random number between 0 and 1000 and assign it to a variable
       #Add tne number to the end of the list of numbers
   #Call findmax, sending the list of random numbers
