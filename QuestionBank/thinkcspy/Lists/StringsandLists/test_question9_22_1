   :feedback_a: Three characters but not the right ones.  namelist is the list of names.
   :feedback_b: Too many characters in this case.  There should be a single letter from each name.
   :feedback_c: Yes, split creates a list of the three names.  The for loop iterates through the names and creates a string from the first characters.
   :feedback_d: That does not make any sense.
