   :answer_a: You should never use a print statement in a function definition.
   :answer_b: You should not have any statements in a function after the return statement.  Once the function gets to the return statement it will immediately stop executing the function.
   :answer_c: You must calculate the value of x+y+z before you return it.
   :answer_d: A function cannot return a number.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Although you should not mistake print for return, you may include print statements inside your functions.
   :feedback_b: This is a very common mistake so be sure to watch out for it when you write your code!
   :feedback_c: Python will automatically calculate the value x+y+z and then return it in the statement as it is written
   :feedback_d: Functions can return any legal data, including (but not limited to) numbers, strings, turtles, etc.

   What is wrong with the following function definition:

   .. code-block:: python

     def addEm(x, y, z):
         return x + y + z
         print('the answer is', x + y + z)
