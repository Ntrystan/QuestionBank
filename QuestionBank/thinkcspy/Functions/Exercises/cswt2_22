   22. Imagine that you have a csv file that holds information about cities. The variable city_file holds the name of the file. Field 3 holds the population. Drag the following instructions to put them in the right order so they define a function that returns the total population for the cities in the file.
   -----
   import csv
   def average_pop(city_file):
   '''Returns the total population of the cities in city_file'''
   =====
       f = open(city_file, 'r')
       reader = csv.reader(f)
   =====
       lines = list(reader)
       f.close()
       total = 0
   =====
       for row in lines:
   =====
           pop = int(row[3])
   =====
           total = total + pop
   =====
       return total
