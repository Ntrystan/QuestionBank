   Use the accumulator pattern to write code to 

   a) Enter an integer value num, add up all the values between 1 and num
   b) Enter an integer value num, have the user input num values, and print the sum
   c) Same as (c), but print the average instead
   d) Print the sum of the values in this list [3, 22, 7, 14, 9]

   Sorry, there is no automatic test for this practice session. Just print the results.
