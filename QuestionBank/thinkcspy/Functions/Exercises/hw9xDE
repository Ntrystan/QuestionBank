   **Homework 9**

    Write a function linear(m,b) that prints out the (x,y) values for the function y = mx + b. Inside your function, use a for loop to generate the list L = [-10,-9,-8,...9,10] of integers from -10 to 10. Then have your function evaluate the formula y = mx+b for all the values x in L. Your function should return all 21 of those y values as a **LIST** and not a string.
    If we were to graph the values of y vs. x, they would lie on a straight line with slope m and y-intercept b.

   Example

    you type>>   linear(2,-1)

    computer returns>>   [-21,-19,-17,-15,...up to 19]

    Leave the input & print statements shown at the end of your code so the function can be tested.

   m = float(input("Enter a slope  "))
   b = float(input("Enter a y-intercept   "))
   print(linear(m,b))
