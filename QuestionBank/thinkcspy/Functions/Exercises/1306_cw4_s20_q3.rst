    **Question 3 [20 points]** The following question is designed to help your understanding of variable name scoping in Python. Please analyze the code carefully and determine what the program will print.  If a particular print statement will cause an error, then just mention that (and assume that the statement is commented out for rest of the program to run.)

    ::

         Line 1.	def findmean(c,a,b):
         Line 2.	    sum = a+b+c
         Line 3.	    mean = sum/3.0
         Line 4.	    print ("Numbers  inside are" , a,b,c)
         Line 5.	    return mean
         
         Line 6.	mean = 0
         Line 7.	a = 4
         Line 8.	b = 2
         Line 9.	c = 11
         Line 10.	answer = findmean (a,b,c)

         Line 11.	print("Numbers entered are", a,b,c)
         Line 12.	print("Answer returned is", answer)
         Line 13.	print("Mean value is", mean)
         Line 14.	print("Sum over here is", sum)
