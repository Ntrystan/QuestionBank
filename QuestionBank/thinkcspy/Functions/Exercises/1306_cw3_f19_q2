   **[30 points] Question 2**. The following question is designed to help your understanding of variable name scoping in Python. Please look at the code carefully and answer what the program will print. Note that a particular print statement will cause an error, then just mention that. You can type the code and run it to verify your answers.


   ::

      def findmean(c,b,a):
        sum_result = a+b+c
        mean = sum_result/3.0
        print ("Numbers  inside are" , a,b,c)
        return mean

      mean = 0
      a = 8
      b = 5
      c = 11
      answer = findmean (a,b,c)

      print("Numbers  entered are", a,b,c)
      print("Answer returned is", answer)
      print("Mean value is", mean)
      print("Sum over here is", sum_result)
