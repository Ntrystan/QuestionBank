    **Question 2 [40 points]**  Write a Python function ``printline(num,sym)`` that takes an integer ``num`` and a symbol ``sym`` as parameters and prints a line with ``sym`` repeated ``num`` times. 

    For example the call ``printline(10,'*')`` will print the pattern below: 
  
    ::

         ************
    
    
    Next write a Python function ``printrectangle(length,height,sym)`` that prints ``height`` lines, each with ``sym`` repeated ``length`` times. You are required to call the function ``printline()`` above  for  printing each line. 

    For example the call ``printrectangle(8, 3,'*')`` will print the pattern below: 
    
    ::

         *********
         *********
         *********

    Next write a Python function ``printtriangle(size,sym)`` that  prints a right angled triangle of length and height ``size`` as illustrated below. You are required to call the function ``printline()`` above  for  printing each line. 

    For example the call ``printtriangle(5,'*')`` will print the pattern below: 

    ::

        *
        **
        ***
        ****
        *****


    Finally write a Python function ``multisquare (num, size, sym)`` that prints  ``size x size`` squares ``num`` times.  You are required to call the function ``printrectangle()`` above  for  printing each square. 

    For example the call ``multisquare(2,3,'*')`` will print the pattern below: 

    ::

        ***
        ***
        ***
        
        ***
        ***
        ***

    
    *(Hint: You can create a blank line with a* ``print(' ')`` *statement.)*
