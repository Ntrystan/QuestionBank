    The "Bar Graph in the chapter "A Turtle Bar Chart" looks a bit squished 
    together. Make an adjustment to the "Bar Graph" algorithm so that there is 
    space between each bar and the label showing the number has a bit of 
    space between the bar and the number. Also, add more space around the 
    bar chart.
 
    +0.25 Use the function you built that writes your initials(or full name) to 
    create a function that will write your name at the bottom left-hand corner 
    of the bar graph.
