    Use the drawsquare function we wrote in this chapter in a program to draw
    the image shown below.
    Assume each side is 20 units.
    (Hint: notice that the turtle has already moved away from the ending point of the last
    square when the program ends.)

    import turtle

    def drawSquare(t, sz):
        """Get turtle t to draw a square of sz side"""

        for i in range(4):
            t.forward(sz)
            t.left(90)

    wn = turtle.Screen()
    wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

    alex = turtle.Turtle()
    alex.color("pink")

    drawSquare(alex,20)

    wn.exitonclick()
