    You have been given two functions

    findAvg ( )  will find the average of 3 quiz scores

    findMax( ) will find the maximum of 3 quiz scores 

    Write a main program that will input 3 of your quiz scores

    Then find the average

    Then find the maxiumum

    Then print the results


    After this works, add code that will do the same for a friend.  


    BONUS:  Write a function that will find the minimum or lowest quiz score.  
    Use that function to print your lowest quiz score and your friends.
