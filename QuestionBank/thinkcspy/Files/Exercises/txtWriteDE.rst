   **Writing to two new files**
   
   This homework is the reverse of the last one. There is a data file posted on wamap called “tvdata.txt” with a t-column and a v-column. Download that file into your homework folder, then write a script in the same folder that reads in that file and writes two (2) output files: one called “time” with the first column of data and one called “velocity” with the second column of data. When you are done, your hard drive should contain two new files, “time” and “velocity”, each consisting of 23 data points.

   There are many different ways to solve this programming problem. Post your solution in the box below.
