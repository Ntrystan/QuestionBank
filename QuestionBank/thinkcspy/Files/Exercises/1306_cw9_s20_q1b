    **Question 1B [25 points]** 
     
    The following refer to a file similar to "qbdata.txt" in section 11.3 of the Runestone book. You need to write the following functions:

    **QBBest(filehandle, rating)** that takes a file handle and a float rating as a parameter and returns a list of quarterback lastnames whose rating is rating or higher.

    ::

        QBBest(filehandle,100) would return ['Vick', 'Rivers', 'Brady', 'Rodgers']
 
    You can test the program by reading the file in your main program and calling these functions.
