   The following sample file called ``studentdata.txt`` contains one line for each student in an imaginary class.  The
   student's name is the first thing on each line, followed by some exam scores.
   The number of scores might be different for each student.

   .. datafile:: studentdata.txt

       joe 10 15 20 30 40
       bill 23 16 19 22
       sue 8 22 17 14 32 17 24 21 2 9 11 17
       grace 12 28 21 45 26 10
       john 14 32 25 16 89

   Using the text file ``studentdata.txt`` write a program that prints out the names of
   students that have more than six quiz scores.
