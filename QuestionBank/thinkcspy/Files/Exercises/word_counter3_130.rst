   Write a program that counts the number of unique words in a 
   text file; use gb.txt as a test file. Write a function
   readfile() that reads the file, removes the punctuation, and
   returns the contents as a lower case string. In main, count
   the number of unique words and print that number and the
   words that only occur one time.

       #Open the file for reading
       #Read the contents as one long string
       #Close the file
       #Remove the punctuation
       #Return the lower-case contents

   def main():
       #Use readfile() to get the text
       #Create an empty list to hold the unique words
       #Split the text into a list of words (split on whitespace)
       #For each word in the word list
           #If the word is not in the word list
               #Add it
       #Print the number of unique words
       #Print the unique words
