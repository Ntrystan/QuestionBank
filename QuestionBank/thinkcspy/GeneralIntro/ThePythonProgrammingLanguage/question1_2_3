   :answer_a: 1 = a process, 2 = a function
   :answer_b: 1 = translating an entire book, 2 = translating a line at a time
   :answer_c: 1 = software, 2 = hardware
   :answer_d: 1 = object code, 2 = byte code
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Compiling is a software process, and running the interpreter is invoking a function, but how is a process different than a function?
   :feedback_b: Compilers take the entire source code and produce object code or the executable and interpreters execute the code line by line.
   :feedback_c: Both compilers and interpreters are software.
   :feedback_d: Compilers can produce object code or byte code depending on the language.  An interpreter produces neither.
