    The following has the correct code to 'swap' the values in x and y (so that x ends up with y's initial value and y ends up with x's initial value), but the code is mixed up and contains <b>one extra block</b> which is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left into the correct order on the right. Check your solution by clicking on the <i>Check Me</i> button.  You will be told if any of the blocks are in the wrong order or if you need to remove one or more blocks.
