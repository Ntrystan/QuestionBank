    DP Regulations
    University has a system whereby students who perform badly, or who do not meet minimum attendance
    dards, are not granted a “DP Certifi cate” (“DP” stands for Duly Performed). Without the “award” of such
    rtifi cate – they do not actually exist in paper form – a student is not permitted to write the fi nal and crucial
    ifying examination in the particular subject. You are expected to attend all class lectures, tutorials, and practical
    ions. The requirement that you submit all assignments and tests is strictly enforced. In particular, each practical
    gnment must be completed and submitted on or before the due date specifi ed for that assignment. Usually you
    given about a week to complete each exercise, and even if you are ill at the time of a practical class you will
    ally be expected to make up the work in your own time.
    EGULATIONS FOR CSC1L1, CSC112, CSC101 & CSC102 ONLY
    nature of the CSc1L1, CSc112, CSc101 and CSc102 semester courses require that a different set of DP regulations
    pplied.
    r your CSc1L DP to be granted, you are required to maintain an average of at least 50% for your practicals,
    achieve an average of at least 40% for your tests.
    r your CSc112, CSc101 and CSc102 DP to be granted, you are required to maintain an average of at least
    for your practicals and achieve an average of at least 40% for your tests.
     extensions will be granted for tests, but you may be eligible to write the make-up test at the end of the
    ster if you have been granted a leave of absence.
    tensions for practicals will only be granted when a leave of absence is granted.
    actical assignments and tests missed without leave of absence will gain you a mark of 0 (zero). It is in your
     interest to ensure that you hand in all practical assignments and write all tests, otherwise, you will endanger
     chances of achieving the minimum requirements as stated above. You are encouraged to keep your test
    practical marks as high as possible so that you don’t endanger your chances of achieving the minimum
    irements.

    lations that apply to the other courses.
    EGULATIONS FOR SENIOR UNDERGRAD COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES
     circumstances dictate (for example in the case of extended illness), an extension of up to three days may be
    wed. Only in exceptional circumstances will extensions beyond that time be allowed and assignments will never
