   :feedback_a: Yes, Python is a great language to learn, whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer. You can write many different styles of programs using the Python language.

   :feedback_c: C is an imperative programming language that has been around for a long time, but it is not the one that we use.
   :feedback_d: No, but JavaScript (different from Java, by the way) is an event driven interpreted language that is very popular for making websites.
