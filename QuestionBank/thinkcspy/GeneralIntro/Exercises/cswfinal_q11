   11. You have been hired to design the image system for a remote sensing satellite that will monitor tree cover in North America. If you use an RGB (Red-Green-Blue) color system, with 9 bits for each color channel (9 bits for Red, 9 bits for Green, and 9 bits for Blue), how many different shades of each color can you represent in each pixel (that is, how many different shades of red, how many shades of green, and how many shades of blue)?
