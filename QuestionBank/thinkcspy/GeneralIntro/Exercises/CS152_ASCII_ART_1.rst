    Visit the site http://www.oocities.org/spunk1111/small.htm to get some ideas for a small shape 
    to draw, then use some print statements to create the shape. If that site is unavailable, then search through https://www.asciiart.eu/food-and-drinks 
    (there are many other sections, but youâ€™ll have to search for a small enough shape to work with).

    Your shape should be at least three lines tall. Use one print statement for each line of the shape. 
    Be aware that  there are some shapes that you probably won't be able to draw easily. 
    If something doesn't work, make a note of it, then pick a different shape.
