   37. What is the computational complexity of the greenscreen algorithm? Hint: Remember that the program has to look at every pixel in the image. Consider, too, how many pixels are in a 10 x 10 image, a 20 x 20 image, a 30 x 30 image, and so forth. There are two images (foreground and background) so the number of operations is doubled - but we ignore the constant multiplier when calculating computational complexity. For example, if an algorithm is O(4N**N) we drop the 4 and just say it's O(N**N).
