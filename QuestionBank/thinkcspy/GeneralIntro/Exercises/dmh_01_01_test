    Write code to assign the variable ``new`` to have the same value that variable ``old`` has. Do not change the first line of code (``old = "Hello"``). Also, do not "hard code" the result by setting ``new = "Hello"``. Instead, write code that would work no matter what the current value of ``old`` is.
    ~~~~
    old = "Hello"
    new = 0
