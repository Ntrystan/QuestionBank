    Google "easy ASCII art" to get some ideas for a small shape to draw, then use some print statements to draw the shape. Your shape should be at least two lines tall. Be aware that  there are some shapes that you probably won't be able to draw easily. If something doesn't work, make a note of it, then pick a different shape.
