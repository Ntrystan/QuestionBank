   11. Perhaps the most famous message in American history is "one if by land; two if by sea." This message, posted by Robert Newman, was carried by the light of lanterns. Imagine that Newman had wanted to send a second message indicating the number of British troops that were embarking that night. Assuming the second message was sent using a binary number, in which a dark lantern represented '0' and a lit lantern represented '1', how many lanterns would Newman have needed to indicate that 700 British troops were marching to Lexington and their date with destiny (count both dark and lit lanterns)?
