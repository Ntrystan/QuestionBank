    Visit the site https://www.asciiart.eu/ to get some ideas for a small shape 
    to "draw" with a series of print statements, then write the code to create the shape.

    Your shape should be at least three lines tall. (But you can keep it on the small side.)
    Use one print statement for each line of the shape. 
    Be aware that  there are some shapes that you probably won't be able to draw easily. 
    If something doesn't work, make a note of it, then pick a different shape.
