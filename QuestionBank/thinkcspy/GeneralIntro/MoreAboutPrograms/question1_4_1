   :answer_a: a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
   :answer_b: something you follow along at a play or concert.
   :answer_c: a computation, even a symbolic computation.
   :answer_d: the same thing as an algorithm.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: It is just step-by-step instructions that the computer can understand and execute.  Programs often implement algorithms, but note that algorithms are typically less precise than programs and do not have to be written in a programming language.
   :feedback_b: True, but not in this context.  We mean a program as related to a computer.
   :feedback_c: A program can perform a computation, but by itself it is not one.
   :feedback_d: Programs often implement algorithms, but they are not the same thing.  An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions, but those instructions are not necessarily precise enough for a computer to follow.  A program must be written in a programming language that the computer knows how to interpret.
