  :feedback_b: Tabs and spaces will sometimes make output appear visually different.
  :feedback_c: A tab has a pre-defined width that is equal to a given number of spaces.
  :feedback_d: You may use spaces to create tables.  The columns might look jagged, or they might not, depending on the width of the items in each column.
