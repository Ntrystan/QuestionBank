   Write a function called ``myPi`` that will return an approximation of PI (3.14159...).  Use the `Leibniz <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80>`_ approximation.

    def myPi(iters):
        # Calculate an approximation of PI using the Leibniz
        # approximation with iters number of iterations
