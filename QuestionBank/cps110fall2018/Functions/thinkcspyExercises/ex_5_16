    Write a function called `myPi` that will return an approximation of PI (3.14159...).  Use the `Madhava <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_of_Sangamagrama>`_ approximation.

    def myPi(iters):
        # Calculate an approximation of PI using the Madhava
        # approximation with iters number of iterations
