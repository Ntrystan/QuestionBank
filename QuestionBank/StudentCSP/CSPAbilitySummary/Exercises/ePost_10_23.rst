   :answer_a: The printed result will be odd with a decimal point.
   :answer_b: The printed result will be even with a decimal point.
   :answer_c: The printed result will be odd without a decimal point.
   :answer_d: The printed result will be even without a decimal point.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if counter or sum had a decimal point.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if this loop ran an even number of times and counter or sum had a decimal point.
   :feedback_c: Since counter starts with a value of 1 and increments by 2 each time it will always be odd.  Sum starts off at 0 and adds counter each time.  This will be odd when there it has added an odd number of values and even when it has added an even number of values.  Since this loops till counter is greater than 10 this will loop 5 times so the result is odd.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the loop ran an even number of times.

   ::
   
      counter = 1
      sum = 0
      while counter <= 10:
