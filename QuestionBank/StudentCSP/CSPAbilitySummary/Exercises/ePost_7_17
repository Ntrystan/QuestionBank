   :feedback_a: This would be true if x was initialized to 0.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the if and else statements weren't there.
   :feedback_c: Since x is initialized to 4 it will print the result of 1000 divided by 4 which is 250.0.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was print ("1000 / x") instead.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if the if and else statements weren't there and if 1000 / 4 gave an integer result.
