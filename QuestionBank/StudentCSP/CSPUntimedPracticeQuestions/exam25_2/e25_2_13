  :feedback_a: Correct. Sophomore is True, so the code block after is executed.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Freshman is False, so this would not be displayed.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Since we know that freshman is False and sophomore are True, the ELSE block after sophomore is not executed.

  Consider the code below.
  
  IF(freshman)
  
   { DISPLAY(“I am a freshman.”) }
  
  ELSE
  
   IF(sophomore)
  
    { DISPLAY(“I am a sophomore”) }
  
   ELSE
  
    { DISPLAY(“Who knows what I am?”) }
  
  If freshman is False and sophomore is True, what is displayed?
