  :answer_b: "I am not a freshman"
  :answer_c: "Who knows what I am?"
  :answer_d: It is impossible to tell with the given information.
  :correct: d
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. Sophomore is False, so this would not be displayed.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. We do not know if freshman is True, so we cannot say whether this would be displayed.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. We do not know if freshman is True, so we cannot say whether this would be displayed.
  :feedback_d: Correct. Since we do not know whether freshman is True, we cannot say whether the code block under freshman is run or if the ELSE statement after sophomore will be executed.

  Consider the code below.
  
  IF(freshman)
  
   { DISPLAY(“I am a freshman.”) }
  
  ELSE
  
   IF(sophomore)
  
    { DISPLAY(“I am a sophomore”) }
  
   ELSE
  
    { DISPLAY(“Who knows what I am?”) }
  
  If the variable sophomore is false, what is displayed?
