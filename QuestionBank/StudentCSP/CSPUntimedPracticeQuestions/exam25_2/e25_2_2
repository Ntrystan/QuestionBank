   :answer_a: Because we started at 0.
   :answer_b: Because the range only extends to 101.
   :answer_c: Because the computer only understands 1s and 0s.
   :answer_d: Because we are using a step of 2.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Since we start at 0, we are counting by even numbers with a step of 2.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Since the range extends to 101, the last number we use is 100.
   :feedback_c: Correct. Binary code is not relevant to why this code stops at 100.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Since we start at 0 and use a step of 2, we are counting by even numbers up to 101.

   Which of the following is NOT why we stop at 100 in the following code?

   sum ← 0

   numbers ← RANGE(0,101,2)

   FOR EACH number IN numbers:

    {
    sum ← sum + number
    }

   DISPLAY(sum)
