  :feedback_a: Incorrect. The code runs for 5 periods total. We start in period 0 with fig = 0 and x = 2. The value for x increases by 1 after each period. So, the values for figure are as follows for every period: After period 2, figure = 3 * 3 = 9 and x = 4; after period 3, figure = 3 * 4 = 12 and x = 5; after period 4, figure = 3 * 5 = 15 and x = 6; after period 5, figure = 3 * 6 = 18 and x = 7. The program will stop after period 5 since figure exceeds 15.

  Consider the following code:
  
  x ← 2
  
  figure ← 0
  
  REPEAT UNTIL figure > 15
  
  {
  
   figure ← 3 * x
  
   x  ← x + 1
  
  }
  
  
  DISPLAY(“figure =”)
  
  DISPLAY(figure)
  
  DISPLAY(“, x =”)
  
  DISPLAY(x)
  
  What is displayed as a result of running the code above?
