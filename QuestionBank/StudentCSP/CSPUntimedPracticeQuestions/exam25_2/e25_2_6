   :answer_a: The following output occurs: 1x
   :answer_b: An error occurs. A person could use the INPUT() function like this, but nothing is entered into the INPUT() function, so nothing would print out.
   :answer_c: The following output occurs: 1 5
   :answer_d: An error occurs. You cannot display the value of variables in programming.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Assigning a value of 1 to variable x does not change its value to 1x.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. This is not true. "5" is entered into the INPUT() function .
   :feedback_c: Correct. When x is displayed in line 2, its value is 1. When x is displayed in line 4, its value is 5.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. This is false. You can displayed the value of variables in programming.

   Refer to the code below. Suppose someone wants to test this. When they reach line 3, they enter “5.” What will happen?

   Line 1: x ← 1

   Line 2: DISPLAY(x)

   Line 3: x ← INPUT()

   Line 4: DISPLAY(x)
