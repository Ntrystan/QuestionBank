   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. This will result in value1 and value2 being the same.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Close! You DO need a temporary variable, but value1 and value2 will still be the same in this case.
   :feedback_c: Correct. By using the variable "temp" you can swap the values of value1 and value2 by storing the original value of value1 in temp.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. The values are only being assigned here, not being swapped.

   A programmer is writing code to swap two user-input values. The program will ask the user for two inputs and stores them in value1 and value2, then switch the two values. Which of the following correctly does this?
   
   
   
   (A)
   ::
   
     value1 ← INPUT()
   
     value2 ← INPUT()
   
     value2 ← value1
   
     value1 ← value2
   
   
   (B)
   ::
   
     value1 ← INPUT()
   
     value2 ← INPUT()
   
     temp ← value1
   
     value2 ← temp
   
     value1 ← temp
   
   
   (C)
   ::
   
     value1 ← INPUT()
   
     value2 ← INPUT()
   
     temp ← value1
   
     value1 ← value2
   
     value 2 ← temp
   
   
   (D)
   ::
   
     value1 ← INPUT()
   
     value2 ← INPUT()
