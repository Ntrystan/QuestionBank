   :answer_a: An algorithm that returns the number of elements that are positive.
   :answer_b: An algorithm that returns true if the first element equals the last.
   :answer_c: An algorithm that calculates the average of the elements in the list.
   :answer_d: An algorithm that swaps the first and second elements in the list.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct. The algorithm will have to iterate through the list and select the positive integers.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. The algorithm will only need to select the first and last integers and compare the values.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. This only requires iteration since no individual values are selected.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. This does not require iteration.
