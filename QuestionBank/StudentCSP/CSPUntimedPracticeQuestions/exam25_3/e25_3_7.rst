   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Look again at which elements are modified in the FOR loop and which items in myLst are displayed in the last line of code.
   :feedback_b: Correct. The first three items in 'myLst' iterate through the loop, are multiplied by 2 and appended to the back of 'myLst.' Then the list is displayed from the fifth item until the end of the list.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. This would be correct if myLst[5:] were displayed.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. This would be correct if you wanted to display myLst[:4] instead of myLst[4:].

   What will print when the following code is run?
   
   ::
   
   
     myLst ← [0,5,10,15,20,25]
     FOR EACH item IN myLst[:3] :
       {       y ← x*2
       myLst.APPEND(y)   }
     DISPLAY(myLst[4:])
