   :feedback_a: Correct. This is a repeating decimal which will result in an overflow error.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Though the solution is undefined, it will not result in an overflow error.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. This will not result in an overflow error but rather a value error.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. This will result in an infinite loop.

   Which of the following is most likely an example of an overflow error?
   
   ::
   
   
     (A)
   
     z ← ⅓
   
   
     (B)
   
     z ← 1/0
   
   
     (C)
   
     nums ← (1, 2, 3)
   
     n ← 0
   
     REPEAT 4 TIMES
   
     n ← n + 1
   
     DISPLAY(nums(n))
   
   
     (D)
   
     n ← 0
   
     REPEAT UNTIL NOT n = 0
   
     n ← n * 100
