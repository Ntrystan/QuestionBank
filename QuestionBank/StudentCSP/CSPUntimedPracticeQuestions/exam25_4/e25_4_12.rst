   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Algorithms with exponential will continually change over time.
   :feedback_b: Correct. Since an exponential function is continually changing, it may not run in reasonable time.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. They can be solved for a specific value.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. It is not necessarily easier to calculate by hand.
