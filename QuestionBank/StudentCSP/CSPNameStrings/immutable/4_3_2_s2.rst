   :feedback_a: This would be correct if we had asked what the value of s3 was. What is the value of s1?
   :feedback_b: This would be true if we asked what the value of s2 was after the code executes.  What is the value of s1?
   :feedback_c: Strings are immutable, meaning they don't change.  Any function that changes a string returns a new string.  So s1 never changes unless you set it to a different string.
