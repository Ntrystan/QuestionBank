   :feedback_a: This would be true if we were printing the value of str and we hand't changed it on line 2.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the first position was 1 and the substring included the character at the end position, but the first character in a string is at position 0 and the substring won't include the character at the last position.
   :feedback_c: This will return a string that starts at position 1 and ends at position 3.
