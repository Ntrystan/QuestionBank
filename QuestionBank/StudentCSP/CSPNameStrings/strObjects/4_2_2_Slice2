   :feedback_a: This will print the character at position 5 in the string which is i.  Remember that the first character is at position 0.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the first character was at position 1 instead of 0.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it returned from the given position to the end of the string, but that isn't what it does.
