   :answer_a: I only
   :answer_b: II only
   :answer_c: III only
   :answer_d: all of them
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: There are no quotes around the string so this gives an error.
   :feedback_b: When you use '+' it appends the strings together so this will print the correct string
   :feedback_c: Answer III will not work since there is no variable called Morrissey.
   :feedback_d: Answer II will work, but not answer I or answer III.  Number I has no quotes around the string. In III there is no variable called Morrissey.
