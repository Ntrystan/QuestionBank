   :feedback_a: Since this while loop continues while number is less than or equal to 10 the last time in the loop it will print Number: 10.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was print ("Number: ", "number").  But since there are no quotes around number it will print the value of number.
   :feedback_c: While number is set to 0 to start it increments each time inside the loop.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the print statement was after number was incremented by 1, but it is before.
