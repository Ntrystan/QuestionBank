   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the print was outside of the loop, but it is in the loop.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was range(1,3)
   :feedback_c: The range(1,4) returns a list with the values 1, 2, and 3.  So this will print hello 3 times.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was range(1,5).  Remember that it includes the first value and ends before the second value.
