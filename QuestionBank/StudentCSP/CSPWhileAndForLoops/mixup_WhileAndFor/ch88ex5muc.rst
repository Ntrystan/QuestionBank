   The following program segment should calculate and print the average of a list of numbers using a for loop. Start by initializing the variable <i>sum</i> and then create the list of numbers.  The blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that ins't needed in the solution. Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>

   sum = 0
   =====
   numbers = [90, 94, 85, 78, 87, 98]
   =====
   for number in numbers:
   =====
       sum = sum + number
   =====
   print(sum / 6)
   =====
   print(sum / 5) #distractor
