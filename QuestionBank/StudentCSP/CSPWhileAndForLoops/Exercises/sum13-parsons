   Put the code blocks in order to return the sum of the numbers in the list 
   nums, returning 0 for an empty list. Except the number 13 is very 
   unlucky, so  it does not count and a number that comes immediately after 
   a 13 also does not count.  For example, sum13([13,1]) returns 0 and sum13([1,13]) returns 1.
