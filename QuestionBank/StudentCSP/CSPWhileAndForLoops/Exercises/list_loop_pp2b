   Put the blocks in order to define a print_BMI_result function that takes a weight and height
   and prints a result.  If the BMImetric is less than 18.5 print "Underweight", otherwise 
   if it is less than or equal 24.9 print "Healthy", otherwise print "Overweight".  
   -----
   def print_BMI_result(weight, height):
   =====
       heightSquared = height * height
       BMI = weight / heightSquared
       BMImetric = BMI * 703
   =====
       if BMImetric < 18.5:
   =====
       if BMImetric > 18.5: #paired
   =====
           print("Underweight")
   =====
           print("Underweight) #paired

       elif BMImetric <= 24.9:
   =====
       if BMImetric <= 24.9: #paired
