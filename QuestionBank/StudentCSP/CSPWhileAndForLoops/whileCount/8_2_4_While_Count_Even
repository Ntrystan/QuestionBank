   The following is the correct code for printing the even numbers from 0 to 10, <b>but it also includes some extra code that you won't need</b>. Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Don't forget to indent blocks in the body of the loop.  Just drag the block to the further right to indent.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
