   Put the code in order to define countInRange that returns a count of the number of times that a target value appears in a list between the start and end indices (inclusive).  For example, countInRange(1,2,4,[1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]) should return 3 since there are three 1's between index 2 and 4 inclusive.

   def countInRange(target, start, end, numList):
   =====
       count = 0
   =====
       count = 1 #paired
   =====
       for index in range(start, end+1):
   =====
       for index in range(start, end): #paired
   =====
           current = numList[index] 
   =====
           current = numList[start] #paired
   =====  
           if current == target:
   =====   
           if index == target: #paired
   =====        
               count = count + 1
   =====        
               count++ #paired
   =====  
       return count
