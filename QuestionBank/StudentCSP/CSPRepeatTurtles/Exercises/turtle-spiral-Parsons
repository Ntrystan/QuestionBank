   Put the code in order to draw a spiral of 'blue' turtle shapes without any lines between them.  Use a range that starts at 5 and ends before 60 and increments by 2 each time through the loop.  In the loop stamp the 'turtle' shape, go forward an increasing amount each time, and turn right 24 degrees.
