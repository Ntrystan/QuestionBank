    Finish writing the function to draw a square using a passed turtle of a passed length.  Call the function in a loop and draw 3 squares with a side length of 50. Draw one at (-100,0), one at (0,0), and one at (100,0).  Don't draw any lines between the squares.

    def square(turtle,length):
        # finish the function here

    from turtle import *
    space = Screen()
    t1 = Turtle()

    # pick up the pen and move to (-100,0)
    
    # loop 3 times drawing squares 100 pixels apart
