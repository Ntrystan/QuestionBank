   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Two possible values of each of red, green, and blue (3 colors) is 2 raised to 3rd power combinations which is 8.
   :feedback_b: Two values of each of red, green, and blue is more than 3.
   :feedback_c: Far fewer
   :feedback_d: That's the total number of colors possible.  But this code reduces that.

   How many different colors will be in our image when we are done?
