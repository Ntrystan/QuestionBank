   :feedback_a: Why would this return 1?  What string was it looking for and where is that string in <code>str</code>
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was <code>str.find("red")</code>.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was <code>str.find("red")</code> and the first position was 1, but it is 0.
   :feedback_d: A -1 is returned when the string you are looking for isn't found.  Remember that case matters in Python!
