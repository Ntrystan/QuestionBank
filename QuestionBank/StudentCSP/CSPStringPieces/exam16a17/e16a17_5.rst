   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if we were using index 2 everywhere instead of index 1.
   :feedback_b: Since arrays indicies start at 0 this will print the 2nd element of a which is 5 and then add one to the second element of b which is 1 and print it.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if we were using index 0 everywhere instead of index 1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we hand't added 1 to b[1] before printing it.
