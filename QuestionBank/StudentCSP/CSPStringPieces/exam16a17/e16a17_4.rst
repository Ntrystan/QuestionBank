   :feedback_a: The for each loop will loop through each character and add it to the front of the result so this will reverse the string.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was resString = resString + char
   :feedback_c: While resString was initialized to the empty string it changes in the for each loop.
   :feedback_d: This is the correct syntax for the for each loop.
