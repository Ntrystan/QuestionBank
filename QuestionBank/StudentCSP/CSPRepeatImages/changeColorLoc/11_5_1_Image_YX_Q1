   :feedback_a: This would be true if we created a new image and set the values in the new image from the old pixel values.
   :feedback_b: This is true since we copy the pixel colors from the current image to the new location.
   :feedback_c: The pixels would be copied to the same row.
   :feedback_d: Compare this image to the original vangogh.jpg image.

   What happened when we copied the pixel color from (x,y) to (y,x)?
