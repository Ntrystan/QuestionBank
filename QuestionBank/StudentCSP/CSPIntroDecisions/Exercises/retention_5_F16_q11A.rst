   Does the following code snippet result in an infinite loop (meaning that the while loop never stops running)?

   .. sourcecode:: python

     a = 1
     while a != 10:
        print ('A')
        a = a + 10

   ..

   -   Yes

       +   Correct! At first, a = 1. In the first iteration, it becomes 11. So, it will never be equal to 10.

   -   No

       -   Incorrect! At first, a = 1. In the first iteration, it becomes 11. So, it will never be equal to 10.
