   Put the code below in order to solve the following problem. There are two extra 
   code blocks that you don't need in a correct solution.  You are driving a little 
   too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to 
   compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 
   2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 
   80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is 
   your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases. 
   First check if it is your birthday and if so then if the speed is less than or equal 65 
   return 0, less than or equal 85 return 1 and otherwise return 2.  If it isn't your 
   birthday then if the speed is less than or equal 60 return 0, less than or equal 80 
   return 1 and otherwise return 2.
