   Put the code in order to define a NumberGuess class that will pick a random number from 1 to 100 in the __init__ method. Create a play method that loops while the current user guess is not equal to the game's pick.  The game will ask the user to pick a number from 1 to 100 and tell the user if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
