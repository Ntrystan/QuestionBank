   Put the blocks in order to define the function diffMaxMin to return the difference between the largest and smallest value in the passed list of numbers (nums). For example, diffMaxMin([1,2,3]) should return 2 since the difference between 3 and 1 is 2. 
   -----
   def diffMaxMin(nums):
   =====
   def diffMaxMin(nums) #distractor
   =====
       large = max(nums)
       small = min(nums)
   =====
       return large - small
   =====
       return small - large #distractor
