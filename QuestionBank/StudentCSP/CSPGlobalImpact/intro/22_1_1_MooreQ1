                :answer_a: It is outdated, as processing power no longer increases.
                :answer_b: It allows for computing industries to effectively plan for future development.
                :answer_c: Moore's law is extremely useful, because it will always be a dependable tool for industries to use.
                :answer_d: All of the above.
                :correct: b
                :feedback_a: While processing power is not increasing at the same exponential rate it used to increase at, it still increases exponentially.
                :feedback_b: Many industries use Moore's law to determine the magnitude of computing power in the future.
                :feedback_c: This is false because Moore's law is expected to end around 2020 due to transistors being unable to be shrunk further.
                :feedback_d: This is false because two of the options are false.
