   :answer_a: We would get an error for doing math in a range function.
   :answer_b: We would get an error because len(myString)/2 is 1.5 which can't be used in a range.
   :answer_c: We would get "M L K" printed with one character per line.
   :answer_d: We would get "M L K " printed with one character per line plus an extra space at the end.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: You are allowed to do math in a range function.
   :feedback_b: Dividing 3 by 2 results in 1.5, which can't be used in a range.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if dividing by 2 was truncated to 1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if 1.5 was rounded to 2, but that doesn't happen.

   What would happen if we changed line 2 to `myList = range(0,len(myString)/2)`? (Hint: You could try it)
