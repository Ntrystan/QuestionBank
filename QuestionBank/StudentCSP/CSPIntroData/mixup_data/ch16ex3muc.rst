   The following program segment should iterate through the strings in <i>list</i> and append them to <i>long_list</i> if the length is greater than 4. But, the blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that isn't needed in the solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>

   list = ["four", "Michigan", "yellow", "at", "blue"]
   long_list = []
   =====
   for each item in list:
   =====
       if len(item) > 4:
   =====
           long_list.append(item)
   =====
           item.append(long_list) #distractor
