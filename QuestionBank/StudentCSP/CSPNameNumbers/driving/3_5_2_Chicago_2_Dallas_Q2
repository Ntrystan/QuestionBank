   :answer_a: 3.45
   :answer_b: 3.65
   :answer_c: costPerGallon
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was printing the value of original variable.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was printing the value of the variable after you changed it to figure out the previous question.
   :feedback_c: Since <code>costPerGallon</code> is in double quotes it is a string, and it will print out those exact characters.

   What would be printed by ``print("costPerGallon")`` if this line was added to the end of the last program?
