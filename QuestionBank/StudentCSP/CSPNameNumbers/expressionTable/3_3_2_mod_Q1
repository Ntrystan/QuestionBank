   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if it was <code>18 % 2</code>, but what is the remainder of 18 divided by 5?
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if it was <code>18 % 17</code>, since 17 goes into 18 one time and the remainder is 18 - 17 = 1.
   :feedback_c: What is the highest multiple of 5 that is less than or equal to 18? The remainder is 18 - that number.
   :feedback_d: The reminder is 3 since 5 goes into 18 three times (15) and 18 - 15 = 3.

   What is the result of ``18 % 5``?
