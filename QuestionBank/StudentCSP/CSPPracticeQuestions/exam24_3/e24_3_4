   Meteorologists record atmospheric data to predict future weather conditions. Suppose that a meteorological lab in Atlanta takes hourly measurements of air temperature and precipitation in the city for a total period of 12 months. Note that the lab also records the exact time and date for each measurement.
   
   Which of the following questions about Atlanta’s weather can be accurately answered using only the data collected by the lab?
