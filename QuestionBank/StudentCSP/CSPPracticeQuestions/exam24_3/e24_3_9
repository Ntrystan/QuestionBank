   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Option II is incorrect. Some problems require algorithms that do not run in reasonable time.
   :feedback_b: Correct. Both of these statements regarding algorithms are true.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Option II is incorrect. Some problems require algorithms that do not run in reasonable time.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. An algorithm that runs in reasonable time refers to a polynomial function of the input size.

   Which of the following statements are true about algorithms?
   
      | I. If an algorithm runs in reasonable time, the number of steps the algorithm takes is a polynomial function (constant, linear, squared, etc.) of the size of the input.
      | II. All problems can be solved using an algorithm that runs in reasonable time.
      | III. If a problem cannot be solved in reasonable time, a heuristic approach is helpful to solve the problem.
