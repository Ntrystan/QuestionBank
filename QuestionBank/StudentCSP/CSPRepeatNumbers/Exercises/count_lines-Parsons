   Put the code in order to define a function that returns a 
   count of the number of lines in the passed file.  It should
   set a count to 0 and open the file for reading.  Then it should 
   read a line from the file.  Next, it will loop while there is a valid line.
   In the loop it will increment the count of lines and read the next line.
   After the loop it will close the file and return the count.

   def count_lines(file):
   =====
       count = 0
       infile = open(file,"r")
   =====
       count = 0
       infile = open(file,"w") #paired
   =====
       line = infile.readline()
   =====
       line = infile.readLine() #paired
   =====
       while line:
   =====
       while line #paired
   =====
           count += 1
           line = infile.readline()
   =====
       infile.close()
