   The following is the correct code for printing the sum of all the even numbers from 50 to 100 using the accumulator pattern, but it is mixed up and <b>contains one extra block</b>. Drag the required blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Don't forget to indent blocks in the body of the loop.  Just drag the block further right to indent.
