    :caption: To find the largest value in a list or sequence, we construct the following loop.

    largest = None
    print('Before:', largest)
    for itervar in [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]:
        if largest is None or itervar > largest :
            largest = itervar
        print('Loop:', itervar, largest)
