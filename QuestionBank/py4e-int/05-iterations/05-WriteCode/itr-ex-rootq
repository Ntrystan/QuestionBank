    The code below is supposed to print an estimate of the square root. But,
    the indention is wrong on 4 lines. Fix these errors to find the estimate.

    target = 6
        guess = 2
    guessSquared = guess * guess
    while abs(target-guessSquared) > 0.01:
        closer = target / guess
    guess = (guess + closer) / 2.0
            guessSquared = guess * guess
        print("Square root of", target, "is", guess)
