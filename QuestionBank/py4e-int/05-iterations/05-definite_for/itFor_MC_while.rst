    :answer_a: it loops through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set
    :answer_b: it loops until some condition becomes True
    :answer_c: it loops until some condition becomes False
    :answer_d: it loops until it reaches a "break" statement
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: A while loop does not run through a known set of items.
    :feedback_b: A while loop continues until the condition is False.
    :feedback_c: A while loop continues until the condition is False. There is not a definite answer to when that happens, it all depends on the incrementation.
    :feedback_d: A while loop can stop at a break statement, but so can any other loop.

    The while loop is an "indefinite" loop because...
