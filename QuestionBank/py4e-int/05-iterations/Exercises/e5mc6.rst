    :answer_b: -4 -3 -2 -1 0
    :answer_c: -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
    :answer_d: This is an infinite loop so it will never print anything.
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: Try again! If x starts at -5 how can the first value printed be 5?
    :feedback_b: Correct! The value of x is incremented before it is printed so the first value printed is -4.
    :feedback_c: Try again! This would be true if the print statement was before we incremented x.
    :feedback_d: Try again! This would be true if it was x = x - 1.

    What does the following code print?

    ::

      output = ""
      x = -5
      while x < 0:
          x = x + 1
          output = output + str(x) + " "
      print(output)
