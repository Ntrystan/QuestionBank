    :answer_a: The program will loop indefinitely
    :answer_b: The value of number will be printed exactly 1 time
    :answer_c: The while loop will never get executed
    :answer_d: The value of number will be printed exactly 5 times
    :correct: a
    :feedback_a: This code loops while number is less than or equal to 5 and number only increments if it is less than 5 and it is originally set to 5 so number never changes.
    :feedback_b: This would be true if it was if number <= 5.
    :feedback_c: This would be true if number was set to a number larger than 5 to start.
    :feedback_d: This would be true if number was set to 1 to start.

    What is the result of executing the following code?

    ::

      number = 5
      while number <= 5:
          if number < 5:
              number = number + 1
          print(number)
