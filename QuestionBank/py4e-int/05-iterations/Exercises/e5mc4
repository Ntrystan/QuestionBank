    :feedback_a: Since this while loop continues while number is less than or equal to 10 the last time in the loop it will print Number: 10.
    :feedback_b: This would be true if it was print ("Number: ", "number"). But since there are no quotes around number it will print the value of number.
    :feedback_c: While number is set to 0 to start it increments each time inside the loop.
    :feedback_d: This would be true if the print statement was after number was incremented by 1, but it is before.

    What is the last thing printed when the following code is run?

    ::

      number = 0
      while number <= 10:
          print ("Number: ", number)
          number = number + 1
