    :answer_a: The program has five iterations but does not print anything.
    :answer_b: The loop will repeat forever and results in an infinite loop.
    :answer_c: The program compiles and prints "1 2 3 4 5 Blastoff!" where each space is a new line.
    :answer_d: The program compiles and prints "5 4 3 2 1 Blastoff!" where each space is a new line.
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: The program doesn't print anything, but has more than 5 iterations.
    :feedback_b: Because the loop is incrementing, rather than decrementing, n will always be greater than 0 and the loop will never end.
    :feedback_c: The program will compile, but will not start with 1 and will print a lot more than that.
    :feedback_d: The program will compile, but will print a lot more than "5 4 3 2 1 Blastoff!"

    Consider the code block below. What happens when you run this program?

    .. code-block:: python

        n = 5
        while n > 0:
            print(n)
            n = n + 1
        print('Blastoff!')
