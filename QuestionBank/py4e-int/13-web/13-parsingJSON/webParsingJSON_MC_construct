    :feedback_a: Dictionaries are used in our JSON, but strings only contain one element, so they are not as useful.
    :feedback_b: Our JSON is constructed by nesting dictionaries and lists as needed.
    :feedback_c: Lists are used in our JSON, but strings only contain one element, so they are not as useful.

    JSON is constructed nesting which pair of variable types?
