    :feedback_a: An API is an application-to-application contract, so it involves some number of applications!
    :feedback_b: An API is an application-to-application contract, therefore it would need more than one application.
    :feedback_c: When we use an API, generally one program makes a set of services available for use by other applications and publishes the APIs (i.e., the “rules”) that must be followed to access the services provided by the program.
