    :feedback_a: Yes, object oriented programming helps you arrange your code so that you
           can only see and work on a part of your code, specially if your code is
           millions of lines long.
    :feedback_b:  No, you can only look at parts of your code but you are not arranging your
           codes in a way that makes reuse of the code and make them 'more elegant'.
    :feedback_c:  No, Conditional code perform different actions depending whether the
           specified criteria is true or false.
    :feedback_d: No, Repetitive coding means repeating a set of instructions for a certain
           number of times or until a certain condition is met.

    What is a way to arrange your code so that you can see parts of your code
    and understand it while ignoring rest of the code for the moment?
