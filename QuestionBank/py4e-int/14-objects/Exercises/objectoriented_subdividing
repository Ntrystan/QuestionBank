    :answer_a: One of the benifits of object-oriented programming is that it can hide complexity.
    :answer_b: An object class contains a number of functions as well as the data that is used by those functions.
    :answer_c: Constructor methods are required to initialize an object and destrcutor methods are required to destroy the
               object when no longer required.
    :answer_d: A powerful feature of object-oriented programming is the ability to create a new class by extending an existing class.
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: This is true, while using an object, we need to know how to use the object class but
                 not how it works internally.
    :feedback_b: This is true  as an object can contain a number of functions as well as data that is used by those functions.
    :feedback_c: This is false, a construtor is optional can be used to set initial values for an object and  python automatically
                 destroys any object if its reference count changes to a zero without needing a destructor.
    :feedback_d: This is true, we can extend a 'parent' class to create a new 'child' class and the new class has access to its functions
                 and can override them if needed.

    Which of the following statements is not true about object-oriented programming?
