  :answer_a: True
  :answer_b: False
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: Try again! python objects do not require constructor or
               destructor functions.
  :feedback_b: Correct, constructor functions are often created to initialize
               variables but not required and python automatically destroys any
               object if its reference count changes to a zero.

  True or False? It is required to have constructor and destructor functions
  for an object.
