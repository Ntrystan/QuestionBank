    The following program should split the lines of "olympics.txt", then print the name,
    team, and event of each athlete in a sentence. Unfortunately the code is mixed up.
    Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in
    the right order. Watch out for extra pieces of code and indentation!
