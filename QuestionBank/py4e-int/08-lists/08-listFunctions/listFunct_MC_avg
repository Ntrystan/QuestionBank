    :feedback_a: The sum function is used to add up all the values in a list to get the numerator of the average.
    :feedback_b: Unfortuantely, avg is not a function in Python.
    :feedback_c: append is a list method. It may be used to add elements to a list that are then averaged together, but not to compute the average itself.
    :feedback_d: The len function is used to count the elements in a list to get the denominator of the average.
    :feedback_e: The max function is not used in averaging. It returns the largest element in a list.

    Which of the following built-in functions can be used on lists to compute the average of the list?
    Select all that apply.
