    :answer_a: The loop will run once.
    :answer_b: Nothing will happen.
    :answer_c: It will cause an error.
    :answer_d: The list will add items to traverse.
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: The loop will not run because the initial conditions are not met. You cannot traverse over nothing.
    :feedback_b: Nothing will happen when traversing through an empty loop because there are no elements to iterate through.
    :feedback_c: It is legal to call this, but nothing will happen. It will not call an error.
    :feedback_d: Python will not add items to the list so it is no longer empty, empty lists are okay.

    What will happen if you attempt to traverse an empty list?
