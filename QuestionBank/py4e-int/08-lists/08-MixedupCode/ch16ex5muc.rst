    The following program segment should iterate through the list <i>terms</i> and then add each
    item to the list <i>vocab</i> if it is not already in the list. If the word is already in
    <i>vocab</i>, then the program should add 1 to the variable "counter". But the blocks have been
    mixed up and include extra blocks that aren't needed in the solution.

    terms = ["accent", "vertigo", "libra", "illusion"]
    vocab = ["hereditary", "illusion", "vertigo", "velocity", "fallacy"]
    counter = 0

    for word in terms:

            vocab.append(word)
