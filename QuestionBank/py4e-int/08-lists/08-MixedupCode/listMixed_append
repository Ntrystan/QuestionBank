    The following program segment should iterate through the strings in <i>list</i> and append them
    to <i>long_list</i> if the length is greater than 4. But, the blocks have been mixed up and
    include an extra block that isn't needed in the solution.
    -----
    list = ["four", "Michigan", "yellow", "at", "blue"]
    long_list = []
    =====
    for each item in list:
    =====
        if len(item) > 4:
    =====
            long_list.append(item)
    =====
            item.append(long_list) #distractor
