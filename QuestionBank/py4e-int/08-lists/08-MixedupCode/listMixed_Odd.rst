    The following program should create a definition countOdd that takes in a list as its argument and
    returns how many odd numbers are in the list. Watch out for extra code blocks and indentation!
    -----
    def countOdd(lst):
    =====
    def countOdd() #distractor
    =====
    odd = 0
    =====
    odd = 1 #distractor
    =====
    for e in lst:
    =====
        if e % 2 != 0:
    =====
        if e % 2 == 0: #paired
    =====
            odd = odd + 1
    =====
    return odd
    =====
    return countOdd #distractor
