    The following program segment should iterate through the list of prices and discount them by
    50%. But, the blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that isn't needed in the solution.
    -----
    price_lst = [21.99, 25.99, 19.99, 10.99, 15.99]
    discounts = []
    =====
    for price in price_lst:
    =====
        new_price = price * .50
    =====
        discounts.append(new_price)
    =====
    for price in discounts: #distractor
    =====
        price.append(price_lst) #distractor
