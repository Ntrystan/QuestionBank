    The following program segment should reverse the order of the list <i>oldList</i>, by storing
    it in the list <i>soFar</i>. Print the result at the end. The blocks have been mixed up and
    include extra blocks that aren't needed in the solution.
    -----
    oldList= [“this”, “is”, “a”, “list”]
    newList=[]
    =====
    for x in range(0, len(oldList)):
    =====
    for x in range(0, list(oldList)): #distractor
    =====
        newList = oldList[x] + newList
    =====
        newList = x[oldList] + newList #distractor
    =====
    print(newList)
