    :answer_b: [2, 0, 2]

    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: That is the original contents of <code>values</code>, but the contents are changed.
    :feedback_b: When you set <code>values[0]</code> to <code>values[1]</code> it makes a copy of the value and doesn't zero it out.
    :feedback_c: The value at index 0 is set to a copy of the value at index 1 and the value at index 2 is incremented.
    :feedback_d: Notice that we do change the value at index 2.  It is incremented by 1.

    What would the following code print?

    ::

      values = [3, 2, 1]
      values[0] = values[1]
      values[2] = values[2] + 1
      print(values)
