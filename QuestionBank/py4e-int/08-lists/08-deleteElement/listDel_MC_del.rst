    :feedback_a: The del method removes part of the list, so it will be shorter.
    :feedback_b: 'a' is the 0th element of the list and 'f' is the 5th element of the list, so these are the values that remain after deleting [1:5].
    :feedback_c: Remember that lists start at 0, not 1, and that a slice stops before the second element - not after.
    :feedback_d: These are the values that will be deleted with the slice [1:5]

    What is the value of alist after the following code executes?

    ::

      alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
      del alist[1:5]
      print(alist)
