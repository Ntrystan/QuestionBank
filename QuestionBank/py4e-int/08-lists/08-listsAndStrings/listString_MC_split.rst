    :answer_a: Smith
    :answer_b: girl
    :answer_c: 65 Elm Street
    :answer_d: eat
    :answer_e: We would get an error
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: That's pieces[1].
    :feedback_b: That's pieces[2]
    :feedback_c: The address is at position 3 in the resulting list.
    :feedback_d: That's pieces[4]
    :feedback_e: Why would this cause an error?  We can use indices to get the element at an index in a list.

    What would print when the following code executes?

    ::

      input = "Pat,Smith,girl,65 Elm Street,eat"
      pieces = input.split(",")
      print(pieces[3])
