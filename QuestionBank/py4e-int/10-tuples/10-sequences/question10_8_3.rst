   :feedback_a: Try again! The iterable is necessary to use sorted(). It is not optional.
   :feedback_b: Correct! The key can be used to sort the iterable in a specific manner, but is not required to use this function.
   :feedback_c: Try again!
   :feedback_d: Correct! Reverse is an optional parameter that, when set true, will sort the iterable in reverse (descending) order.
