   How will the following code be sorted once this code is run?

   .. code-block:: python

      weather = {'Reykjavik': {'temp': 60, 'condition': 'rainy'}, 'Buenos Aires': {'temp': 55, 'condition': 'cloudy'}, 'Cairo' : {'temp': 96, 'condition': 'sunny'}, 'Berlin' : {'temp': 89, 'condition': 'sunny'}, 'Caloocan' : {'temp': 78, 'condition': 'sunny'}}
      sorted_weather = weather.sort(key = lambda x: (x, weather[x]['temp']))
