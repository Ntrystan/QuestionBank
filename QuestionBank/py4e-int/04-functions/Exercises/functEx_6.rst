    :feedback_a: The function square returns the square of its input (via a call to pow)
    :feedback_b: What is printed is the output of the square function.  5 is the input to the square function.
    :feedback_c: Notice that pow is called from within square with a base (b) of 5 and a power (p) of two.
    :feedback_d: Notice that pow is called from within square with a base (b) of 5 and a power (p) of two.

    Consider the following Python code. What does this function print?
    Note that line numbers are included on the left.

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        def pow(b, p):
            y = b ** p
            return y

        def square(x):
            a = pow(x, 2)
            return a

        n = 5
        result = square(n)
        print(result)
