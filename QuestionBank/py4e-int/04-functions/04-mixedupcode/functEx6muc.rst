    The following code creates the function caught_speeding, which calculates the ticket you get if
    you are caught speeding. If you are driving 60 mph or under you do not get a ticket and the function
    returns 0, if you are driving between 61 and 80 mph, you get a ticket and the function returns 1. If you
    are driving more than 80 mph, you get a larger ticket and the function returns 2. Luckily, if it is your
    birthday, you can drive 5 mph above the speed limit. There are two extra code blocks and lots of
    indentation to watch out for!
