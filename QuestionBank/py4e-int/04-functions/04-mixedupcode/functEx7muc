    Create a function called addByThree, which will add three to the total for each number within the range of
    the parameter (num) starting from 0. The function should return the total. Watch out for
    extra pieces of code and indentation!
    -----
    def addByThree(num):
    =====
        total = 0
    =====
        total = 1     #paired
    =====
        for counter in range(num):
    =====
        for counter in range(thesum): #distractor
    =====
            total = total + 3
    =====
            total = total + three #distractor
    =====
        return total
