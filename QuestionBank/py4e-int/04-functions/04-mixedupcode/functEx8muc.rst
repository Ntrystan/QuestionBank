    Create a function called add_odd, which will add up odd numbers within the range of the parameter (num)
    starting from 1. The function should return thesum. Watch out for extra pieces of code and indentation!
    -----
    def add_odd(num):
    =====
        thesum = 0
        oddnumber = 1
    =====
        thesum = 1     #paired
        oddnumber = 1
    =====
        for counter in range(num):
    =====
        for counter in range(thesum): #distractor
    =====
            thesum = thesum + oddnumber
            oddnumber = oddnumber + 2
    =====
            thesum = thesum + oddnumber #distractor
            oddnumber = oddnumber + 1
    =====
        return thesum
