    The following code should create the function get_avg_drop_lowest, that takes a list of numbers as its
    parameter. The function will calculate the sum of the numbers, identify the smallest number, and the
    amount of numbers in the list; then return the average of the list, dropping the lowest number if the
    list has multiple numbers. Watch out for extra pieces of code and indentation!

    def get_avg_drop_lowest(num_list):
    =====
    def get_avg_drop_lowest(num_list) #paired
    =====
        total = sum(num_list)
        lowest = min(num_list)
        num = len(num_list)

        if num == 1:
    =====
        if num = 1: #paired
    =====
            return total

        else:
    =====
            return (total - lowest) / (num - 1)
    =====
            return (total - lowest) / (num + 1) #paired
