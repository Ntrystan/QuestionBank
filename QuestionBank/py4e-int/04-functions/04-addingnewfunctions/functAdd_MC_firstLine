    :answer_a: body; header
    :answer_b: title; body
    :answer_c: header; body
    :answer_d: initialization; body
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Close, but the order is off. Where does a header typically go?
    :feedback_b: Body is correct, but title is not.
    :feedback_c: The header is the first line of a function definition and the rest is the body.
    :feedback_d: We initialize variables, but functions are defined.

    What is the first line of a function definition called? What is every line after the first line called?
