    :feedback_a: In Python, you do not need to specify a new line like in some other languages. The print statements themselves just need to be on two separate lines.
    :feedback_b: Since the functions are separate, the results will print on different lines.
    :feedback_c: The value of "hi" does not change outside of the function unless specified.
    :feedback_d: In Python, you do not need to specify a new line like in some other languages. The print statements themselves just need to be on two separate lines.

    Consider the code block below. What prints?

    .. code-block:: python

        def add_two(num):
            num = num + 2
            print(num)

        def add_three(nums):
            nums = nums + 3
            print(nums)

        hi = 4
        add_two(hi)
        add_three(hi)
