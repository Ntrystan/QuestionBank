    :feedback_c: Correct! This line of code uses print so that the number is printed and not just returned, and it makes sure to include the default value in case 'Russell' does not appear in the dictionary.
    :feedback_d: Try again!

    Which use of the get method correctly returns the amount of times the name "Russell" appears in the dictionary names?

    .. code-block:: python

       names = {'James' : 10, 'Russell' : 2, 'Kevin' : 27}
