   Construct a code block to transform the lists 'keys' and 'values' into one dictionary. Make sure to print the dictionary once the loop terminates.
   -----
   keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
   =====
   values = [10, 20, 30]
   =====
   combination = dict()
   =====
   for i in len(keys):
   =====
   for i in keys(): #distractor
   =====
    if keys[i] not in combination.keys():
   =====
    if keys[0] not in combination.keys(): #distractor
   =====
     combination[keys[i]] = values[i]
   =====
     combination[keys] = values #distractor
   =====
   print(combination)
