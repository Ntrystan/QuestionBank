   :answer_a: Run through the entire code all at once to try and find bugs
   :answer_b: Split the debugging into stages by scaling down the input
   :answer_c: Assume your code is perfect and move on
   :correct:  b
   :feedback_a: Try again!
   :feedback_b: Correct! When dealing with large portions of data, it is best to separate testing into smaller pieces so you can more clearly see where the errors might be coming from.
   :feedback_c: Try again!
