    :feedback: What keywords make sense with each command?
    :match_1: INSERT||| INTO; VALUES
    :match_2: SELECT||| FROM
    :match_3: UPDATE||| SET; WHERE
    :match_4: DELETE||| FROM; WHERE

    Match each SQL command with the keywords needed for it to run. **Note** Some commands
    are optional, but omitting them tends to have unintended consequences.
