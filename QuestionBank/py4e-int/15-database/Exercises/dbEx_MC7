    :answer_a: SELECT FROM Breed,Cats
    :answer_b: SELECT Cats FROM Breed
    :answer_c: SELECT Breed FROM Cats
    :answer_d: FROM Cats SELECT Breed
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: This has all the correct words, but they are quite mixed up. No commas necessary here!
    :feedback_b: This uses the right order, but the wrong commands.
    :feedback_c: This command is very straight forward! It <i>selects</i> the <i>breed</i> <i>from</i> the table <i>cats</i>
    :feedback_d: This uses the right commands in the wrong order.

    Which is the correct command for a statement that will select the Breed column from the Cats table?
