   The following program segment should ask the user their hours per week and pay rate,
   then print a statement with their gross pay. But, the blocks have been mixed up and
   includes extra blocks that aren't correct.
   -----
   hours = input('How many hours do you work in a week?')
   =====
   payRate = input('What is your hourly pay?')
   =====
   pay rate = input('What is your hourly pay?') #distractor
   =====
   grossPay = hours * payRate
   =====
   print("Your gross pay is " + grossPay)
   =====
   print("Your gross pay is" grossPay) #distractor
