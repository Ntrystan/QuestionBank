  The following program segment should print how much you will have to pay for an item that is 60% off
  the original price of $52.99. But, the blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that isn't
  needed in the solution.
  -----
  price = 52.99
  discount = 0.6
  =====
  savings = price * discount
  =====
  savings = price / discount #paired
  =====
  finalPrice = price - savings
  =====
  print(finalPrice)
  =====
  finalPrice = price - discount #distractor
