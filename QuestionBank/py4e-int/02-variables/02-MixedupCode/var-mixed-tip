   The following program segment should print out the cost per person for a dinner including the tip.
   But, the blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that isn't needed in the solution.
   -----
   bill = 89.23
   =====
   tip = bill * 0.20
   =====
   total = bill + tip
   =====
   numPeople = 3
   perPersonCost = total / numPeople
   =====
   print(perPersonCost)
   =====
   print(perpersoncost) #distractor
