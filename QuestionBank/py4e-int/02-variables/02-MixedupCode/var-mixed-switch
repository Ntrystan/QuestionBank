   The following program segment should swap the values of x and y after val1 and val 2 are assigned
   to x and y, respectively. But, the blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that isn't
   needed in the solution.
   -----
   x = val1
   y = val2
   =====
   temp = x
   =====
   x = y
   =====
   y = temp
   =====
   temp = y #distractor
