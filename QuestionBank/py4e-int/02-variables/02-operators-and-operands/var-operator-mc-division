    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: If the two values are both integers (whole numbers) you will normally get an integer (whole number) result in older Python environments.  But, this book is using Python 3 so you get a decimal result.
    :feedback_b: This would be correct if the result was rounded up before the values after the decimal point were thrown away, but it does not do this.
    :feedback_c: While this isn't the what older Pyton development environments would return, in this book we are using Python 3 so it returns a decimal result.
    :feedback_d: This would be correct if it was <code>1 / 4</code>, <code>1.0 / 4</code>, or <code>1 / 4.0</code>

    What is the result of ``3 / 4``?
