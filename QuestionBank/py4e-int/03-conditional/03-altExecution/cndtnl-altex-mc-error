    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: Every else-block must have exactly one corresponding if-block.  If you want to chain if-else statements together, you must use the else if construct, described in the chained conditionals section.
    :feedback_b: This will cause an error because the second else-block is not attached to a corresponding if-block.

    Will the following code cause an error?

    .. code-block:: python

      x = -10
      if x < 0:
          print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
      else:
          print(x, " is a positive number")
      else:
          print("This is always printed")
