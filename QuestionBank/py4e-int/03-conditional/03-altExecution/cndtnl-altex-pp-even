    The following program should print out "x is even" if the remainder of x divided by 2 is 0 and "x is odd"
    otherwise, but the code is mixed up. Be sure to indent correctly!
    -----
    x = 92
    =====
    if x % 2 == 0:
    =====
        print("x is even")
    =====
    else:
    =====
        print("x is odd")
