    :answer_a: x &lt; 0 or &gt; 25
    :answer_b: x &gt; 0 or x &lt; 5
    :answer_c: x &gt; 0 and x &lt; 5
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: Try again. Neither value is less than 0 or greater than 25.
    :feedback_b: Correct! This expression will evaluate to true for all numbers that are either greater than 0 or less than 5.  Because all numbers are either greater than 0 or less than 5, this expression will always be True.
    :feedback_c: Try again. With an and keyword both expressions must be true so the number must be greater than 0 and less than 5 for this expression to be true.

    Which of the following includes the numbers 7 and 24?
