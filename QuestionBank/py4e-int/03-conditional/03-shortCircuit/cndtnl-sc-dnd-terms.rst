    :feedback: What is the purpose of each term?
    :match_1: guardian pattern|||A logical expression with additional comparisons to take advantage
              of the short circuit behavior.
    :match_2: short circuit|||When Python is part-way through evaluating a logical expression and stops
              the evaluation because Python knows the final value for the expression without needing to
              evaluate the rest of the expression.
    :match_3: guard||| A comparison put in place to cause short circuit behavior and avoid a runtime error.

    Match each term with its meaning.
