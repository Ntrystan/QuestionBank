    :answer_a: True
    :answer_b: 3 == 4
    :answer_c: 3 + 4
    :answer_d: 3 + 4 == 7
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Try again. True and False are both Boolean literals.
    :feedback_b: Try again. The comparison between two numbers via == results in either True or False (in this case False),  both Boolean values.
    :feedback_c: 3 + 4 evaluates to 7, which is a number, not a Boolean value.
    :feedback_d: Try again. 3 + 4 evaluates to 7.  7 == 7 then evaluates to True, which is a Boolean value.

    Which of the following is **not** a boolean expression?
