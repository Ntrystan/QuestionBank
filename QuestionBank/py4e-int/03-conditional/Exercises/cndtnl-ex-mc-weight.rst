    What is the total for 12 items that weigh 3 pounds?

    ::

      weight = 0.5
      numItems = 5
      if weight < 1:
          price = 1.45
      if weight >= 1:
          price = 1.15
      total = weight * price
      if numItems >= 10:
          total = total * 0.9
      print(weight)
      print(price)
      print(total)
