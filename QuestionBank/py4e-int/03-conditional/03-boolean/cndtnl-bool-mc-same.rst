    :answer_a: x = y
    :answer_b: x != y
    :answer_c: x == y
    :answer_d: x is y
    :answer_e: x is not y
    :correct: d
    :feedback_a: Try again. This reassigns the value of y to x.
    :feedback_b: Try again. This means that x is not equal to y.
    :feedback_c: Try again. This means that x and y have the same value, but it does not mean they are the same object.
    :feedback_d: This means that x and y are the same object, not just the same value.
    :feedback_e: Try again. This means that x and y are not the same object. This can be true if x and y have the same value, but are stored in different objects.

    Which of the following comparison operators is used to check if x and y are the same object?
