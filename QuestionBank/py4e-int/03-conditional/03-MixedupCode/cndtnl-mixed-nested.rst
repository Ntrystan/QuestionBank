    Arrange the following code so that after x and y are defined, they are compared and if the value of x
    is less than y it prints ``"x is less than y"``; if x is greater than y it prints ``"x is greater
    than y"``; and prints ``"x and y must be equal"`` if the values are equal. Be sure to indent correctly!
