    The following program should print ``x is a number from 1 to 10`` if the value of x is 1-10,
    ``x is a number less than 1`` if the value of x is zero or below, and ``x is a number greater than 10``
    if the value of x is more than 10. Be sure to indent correctly and look out for extra code blocks!
