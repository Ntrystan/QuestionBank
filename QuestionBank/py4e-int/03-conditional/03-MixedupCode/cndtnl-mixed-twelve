    Arrange the code to calculate and print the cost of a 14 mile cab ride. If the distance traveled
    is less than or equal to 12 miles the cost is $2.00 a mile, and if the distance traveled is more
    than 12 miles the cost is $1.50 a mile. Be sure to indent correctly and look out for extra code blocks!

    distance = 14

    if distance <= 12:

        rate = 1.50
