    The following program should determine whether a number is odd or even, but the lines are mixed up.
    Be sure to indent correctly and watch out for extra pieces of code!
    -----
    x = 3
    =====
    if x % 2 == 0:
    =====
    if x / 2 == 0: #paired
    =====
    print("x is even!")
    =====
    else:
    =====
    print("x is odd")
    =====
    elif x % 2 == 1: #distractor
