    :answer_d: all values of x
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Try again. This would be true if the second expression was x <= 10.
    :feedback_b: Try again. This would be true if the first logical expression was x >= 0.
    :feedback_c: The "condition true" will only be printed when x is greater than 0 and less than 10 so this is the range from 1 to 9.
    :feedback_d: Try again. This would be true if the conditional was x > 0 <b>or</b> x < 10.

    Given the code below, what describes the values of x that will cause the code to print "condition true"?

    ::

        if x > 0 and x < 10:
            print ("condition true")
        print ("All done")
