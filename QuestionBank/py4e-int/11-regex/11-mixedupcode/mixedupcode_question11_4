    The following code should use create a regular expression pattern for the word "Puppy"
    and test it on the sequence. If they are the same, it should print "Match!", if not it
    should print "Not a match!". The blocks have been mixed up, and include two extra blocks
    that are not correct. Watch out for the extra blocks and indentation!
