   The following code should use regular expressions to print each item in the list
   "greetings", if it starts with an "H" or an "h". The blocks have been mixed
   up, and include two extra blocks that are not correct. Watch out for the extra
   blocks and indentation!
   -----
   import re
   =====
   greetings = ["Hello!", "hello.", "Good Morning!", "good morning!", "Good morning!", "hi"]
   =====
   for item in greetings:
   =====
    if re.search('^[Hh]', item):
   =====
    if re('[Hh]', item): #distractor
   =====
    if re('^H,h'), item): #distractor
   =====
     print(item)
