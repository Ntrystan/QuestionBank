   The following code should use regular expressions to find and print the phrase
   "Good morning!" from the list "greetings", if it is included in the list.
   The blocks have been mixed up, and include two extra blocks that are not correct.
   Watch out for the extra blocks and indentation!
   -----
   import re
   =====
   greetings = ["Hello!", "hello.", "Good Morning!", "good morning!", "Good morning!", "hi"]
   =====
   for item in greetings:
   =====
    if re.search('Good morning!', item):
   =====
    if re('Good Morning!', item): #distractor
   =====
     print(item)
   =====
     print(greetings) #distractor
