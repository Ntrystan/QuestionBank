   :answer_a: The program removes all the red from the image
   :answer_b: The program changes all the red pixels to a single color
   :answer_c: The program changes all the pixels to have some red
   :answer_d: The program changes the image to only have 3 values of red
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the red was always set to 0.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the red was always set to the same value.
   :feedback_c: If r is less than 120 the red is removed (set to 0).
   :feedback_d: The red will be sets to 0, 200, or 255.

   What does the following code do to the image?

   ::

      from image import *

      # CREATE AN IMAGE FROM A FILE
      img = Image("arch.jpg")

      # LOOP THROUGH ALL PIXELS
      for x in range(img.getWidth()):
          for y in range(img.getHeight()):
              p = img.getPixel(x, y)
              r = p.getRed()
              g = p.getGreen()
              b = p.getBlue()

              # VALUES FOR THE NEW COLOR
              if r < 120:
                  r = 0
              elif r < 240:
                  r = 200
              else:
                  r = 255

              # CREATE THE COLOR
              newPixel = image.Pixel(r,g,b)

              # CHANGE THE IMAGE
              img.setPixel(x, y, newPixel)

      win = ImageWin()
      img.draw(win)
