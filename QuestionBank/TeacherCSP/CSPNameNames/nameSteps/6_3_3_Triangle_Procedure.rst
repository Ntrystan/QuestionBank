   The following code should define a procedure that draws a triangle, but it may be mixed up <i>and may contain extra (unused) code</i>.  Drag the needed code to the right side in the correct order.  <b>Remember that the statements in the procedure must be indented!</b>  To indent a block drag it further right.
