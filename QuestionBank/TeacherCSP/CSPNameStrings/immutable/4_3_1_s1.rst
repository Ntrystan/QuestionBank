   :answer_b: xyxyz
   :answer_c: xy xy z
   :answer_d: xy z
   :answer_e: z
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: s1 will equal "xy" plus another "xy" then z at the end.
   :feedback_b: s1 contains the original value, plus itself, plus "z"
   :feedback_c: No spaces are added during concatenation.
   :feedback_d: No spaces are added during concatenation, and an additional "xy" should be included at the beginning.
   :feedback_e: s1 was set to "xy" initially, so the final answer will be "xyxyz"

   Given the following code segment, what is the value of the string s1 after these are executed?

   ::

     s1 = "xy"
     s2 = s1
     s1 = s1 + s2 + "z"
