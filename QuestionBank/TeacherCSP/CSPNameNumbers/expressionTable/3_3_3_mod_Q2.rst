   :answer_d: 6
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if it was <code>6 % 2</code>.
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if it was some odd number divided by 2, but it is not.
   :feedback_c: 6 goes into 2 zero times with 2 left over.
   :feedback_d: If you have a smaller number divided by a larger number the remainder is always the smaller number.

   What is the result of ``2 % 6``?
