                  :feedback_a: A range goes from a starting point to one <i>less</i> than the ending point. If we want to count to 10, use range(1,11).
                  :feedback_b: The range doesn't include the end value.  It stops at one before the last value.
                  :feedback_c: In fact, it doesn't even get to 10! Try it.

                  What is the last value that will be printed when the code below executes?
