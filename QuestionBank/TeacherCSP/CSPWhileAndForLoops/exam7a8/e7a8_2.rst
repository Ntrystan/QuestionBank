   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the print was outside of the loop, but it is in the loop.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was range(1,3)
   :feedback_c: The range(1,4) returns a list with the values 1, 2, and 3.  So this will print hello 3 times.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was range(1,5).  Remember that it includes the first value and ends before the second value.

   When the following code is run, how many times is hello printed?

   ::

      helloArray = range(1,4)
      for x in helloArray:
          print ("hello")
