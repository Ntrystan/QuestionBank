   :feedback_a: Counter is incremented each time the loop executes.
   :feedback_b: The last value to be printed is 10.  But, the counter is incremented after the current value is printed.
   :feedback_c: Counter gets incremented to 11 after printing, and then the while loop tests counter, finds counter is not less than 11 and then continues after the body of the loop.

   What is the value of counter after the loop finishes executing?
