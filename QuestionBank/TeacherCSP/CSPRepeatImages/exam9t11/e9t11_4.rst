   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was p.setGreen(g * 2) and p.setBlue(b * 2)
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was p.setGreen(g / 2) and p.setBlue(b / 2)
   :feedback_c: This sets the green values to half the original blue values and the blue values to half the original green values.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was p.setGreen(b * 2) and p.setBlue(g * 2)

   What does the following code do?

   ::

      from image import *
      img = Image("beach.jpg")
      pixels = img.getPixels()
      for p in pixels:
          g = p.getGreen()
          b = p.getBlue()
          p.setGreen(b / 2)
          p.setBlue(g / 2)
          img.updatePixel(p)
      win = ImageWin(img.getWidth(), img.getHeight())
      img.draw(win)
