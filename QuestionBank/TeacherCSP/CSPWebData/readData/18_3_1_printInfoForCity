   The following program prints the pollution information for all cities that start with a ``D``, but the code is mixed up.  Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.  Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or have the wrong indention.

   # open the file for reading

   # read a line from the file
   line = inFile.readline()

       # split at the :
       v = line.split(":")

       # get the city
       city = v[0]
   =====
       # if city starts with an D print info
       if (city.find("D") == 0):
