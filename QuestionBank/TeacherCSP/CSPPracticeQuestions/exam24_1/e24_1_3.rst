   :answer_a: Yes, the code correctly switches the values of 'a' and 'b'.
   :answer_b: No, but it will work correctly if statements 1. and 3. are switched.
   :answer_c: No, but it will work correctly if statements 2. and 3. are switched.
   :answer_d: No, but it will work correctly if statements 1. and 2. are switched.

   A programmer is writing code to switch the values of two integer variables, namely ``a`` and ``b``, using a temporary integer variable, ``temp``. This is the pseudo-code that the programmer has come up with:
   ::

    temp ← a  # statement 1.
    b ← temp  # statement 2.
    a ← b     # statement 3.

   Will the pseudo-code correctly perform the required task (assume that ``a`` and ``b`` are never numerically equal)?
