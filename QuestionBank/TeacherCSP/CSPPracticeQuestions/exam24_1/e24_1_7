   Consider the following incomplete pseudo-code to print the largest of three integer variables, namely ``a``, ``b`` and ``c``:
   ::

     IF (a ≥ b)
     {
        IF (*incomplete_1*)
        {
            DISPLAY(a)
        }
        ELSE
        {
            DISPLAY(c)
        }
     }
     ELSE
     {
        IF (*incomplete_2*)
        {
            DISPLAY(c)
        }
        ELSE
        {
            DISPLAY(b)
        }
     }

   Which of the following options can be substituted for *incomplete_1* and *incomplete_2*, respectively, for the code to work as intended?
