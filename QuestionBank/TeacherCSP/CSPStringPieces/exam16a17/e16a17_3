   :answer_b: Brown
   :answer_c: football
   :answer_d: Charlie Brown
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was "Charlie Brown boy football" and we were splitting at the space characters.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was "Charlie Brown boy football" and we were splitting at the space characters and it was name = pieces[1]
   :feedback_c: This is the value of sport.
   :feedback_d: The split function splits the string at the passed character which is a comma so the name is everything before the first comma.

   What is the value of name after executing the following code?

   ::

      from image import *
      def example (nameInput, ageInput):
          pieces = nameInput.split(",")
          name = pieces[0]
          gender = pieces[1]
          sport = pieces[2]
          age = ageInput

       example("Charlie Brown,boy,football", 8)
