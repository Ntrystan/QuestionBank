   :feedback_a: This will only print when both check_systolic and check_diastolic return 0 which is when check_systolic is passed a number less than 120 and check_diastolic is passed a number less than 80.
   :feedback_b: This will only print when either check_systolic or check_diastolic return 3 which is when check_systolic is passed a number greater or equal to 180 and check_diastolic is passed a number greater than or equal to 110.
   :feedback_c: This will print when check_systolic was 1 and check_diastolic was greater than 1 (but not 3).
   :feedback_d: This will print when check_systolic was 1 and check_diastolic was less than or equal to 1.
   :feedback_e: That is okay.  We do not expect you to know this.

   What is the output from the program below?
