   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: If x starts at -5 how can the first value printed be 5?
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the print statement was before we incremented x.
   :feedback_c: The value of x is incremented before it is printed so the first value printed is -4.

   What does the following code print?

   ::

      output = ""
      x = -5
      while x < 0:
          x = x + 1
          output = output + str(x) + " "
      print(output)
