   Fill in the values Solver found for the slope |blank| and intercept |blank|.
   
   - :0.976.*: Is the correct answer
     :1.965.*: Is the intercept not the slope
     :0: It is likely you are trying to use a linear solver instead of the LSGRG
     :x: Check your settings and try running solver again.
   
   - :1.96.*|1.97: Is the correct answer
     :0.976.*: Is the slope to the intercept
     :0: It is likely you are using the wrong solver
     :x: Check your settings and try running solver again
