        Complete the sentence: |blank| had a |blank| lamb. One plus one is: (note that if there aren't enough blanks for the feedback given, they're added to the end of the problem. So, we don't **need** to specify a blank here.)

        -   :Mary: Is the correct answer.
            :Sue: Is wrong.
            :x: Try again. (Note: the last item of feedback matches anything, regardless of the string it's given.)
        -   :little: That's right.
            :.*: Nope.
        -   :2: Right on! Numbers can be given in decimal, hex (0x10 == 16), octal (0o10 == 8), binary (0b10 == 2), or using scientific notation (1e1 == 10), both here and by the user when answering the question.
            :2 1: Close.... (The second number is a tolerance, so this matches 1 or 3.)
            :x: Nope. (As earlier, this matches anything.)

    config values (conf.py):

    - fitb_div_class - custom CSS class of the component's outermost div
