   :answer_b: No
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: While there is a method that calculates the price correctly, it is the wrong method.
   :feedback_b: There is no <code>getPrice</code> method so the student can not earn this point.

   Should the student earn 1 point for correctly calculating the price and making it available to be returned from ``getPrice``?
