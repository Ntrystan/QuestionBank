   :answer_a: Use four unrelated classes: <code>Car</code>, <code>Doors</code>, <code>AirConditioning</code>, and <code>MilesPerGallon</code>.
   :answer_b: Use a class <code>Car</code> with three subclasses: <code>Doors</code>, <code>AirConditioning</code>, and <code>MilesPerGallon</code>.
   :answer_c: Use a class <code>Car</code>, with fields: <code>numDoors</code>, <code>hasAir</code>, and <code>milesPerGallon</code>.
   :answer_d: Use a class <code>Car</code>, with subclasses of <code>Doors</code>, <code>AirConditioning</code>, and <code>MilesPerGallon</code>.
   :answer_e: Use classes: <code>Doors</code>, <code>AirConditioning</code>, and <code>MilesPerGallon</code>, each with a subclass <code>Car</code>.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Only <code>Car</code> should be a class. The number of doors, flag if it has air conditioning, and the average number of miles per gallon are attributes of a car so they belong in a <code>Car</code> class.
   :feedback_b: Doors, air conditioning, and miles per gallon are not a kind of car. Child classes need to be able to be substituted for the parent class.
   :feedback_c: The number of doors, flag if it has air conditioning, and the average number of miles per gallon are attributes of a car. Each of these is a simple value so they can just be fields of a <code>Car</code> class.
   :feedback_d: A door is not a type of car. A flag for air conditioning is not a type of door, and a miles per gallon is not a type of air conditioning flag. Child classes need to be able to be substituted for the parent class.
   :feedback_e: A class <code>Car</code> can't be a subclass of three different classes. Each class can only have one parent class. Also a car is not a type of door, air conditioning flag, or miles per gallon. Child classes need to be able to be substituted for the parent class.

    A car dealership needs a program to store information about the cars for sale. For each car, they want to keep track of the following information: number of doors (2 or 4), whether the car has air conditioning, and its average number of miles per gallon. Which of the following is the best design?
