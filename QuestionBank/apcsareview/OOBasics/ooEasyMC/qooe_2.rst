   :answer_a: The methods do different things.
   :answer_b: The methods have different parameter names.
   :answer_c: The methods have different post-conditions.
   :answer_d: Two methods with the same name can never be included in the same class.
   :answer_e: The methods have different numbers of parameters
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: Methods that do different things should be named differently.
   :feedback_b: There is no reason the parameter names ought to be different if the two methods are performing the same action.
   :feedback_c: If the methods have different post-conditions, they are performing different functions, and should be named differently.
   :feedback_d: If two methods perform the same function, they can be named the same.  However, the number of parameters, type of parameters, or order of parameter types must be different.
   :feedback_e: Overloading occurs when two methods perform the same essential operation, but take a different number and/or type of parameters.

   Under which of these conditions is it appropriate to overload a method (ie: the class will contain two methods with the same name)?
