   :answer_a: nums[3][2]
   :answer_b: nums[2][3]
   :answer_c: nums[2][1]
   :answer_d: nums[1][2]
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if array indices started with 1 but they start with 0.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if array indicies started with 1 and the column was specified first.  However, array indices start at 0 and the row is given first in row-major order.
   :feedback_c: Array indices start with 0 so the third row has an index of 2 and the second column has an index of 1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the column index was first, but in row-major order the row index is first.

   Which of the following would I use to get the value in the third row and second column from a 2D array called ``nums``?
