   :answer_a: C c1 = new C();
   :answer_b: B b1 = new B();
   :answer_c: B c2 = new C();
   :answer_d: B b3 = new B(10);
   :answer_e: C c3 = new C(24);
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: Here we are simply creating a new instance of class C by calling the appropiate constructor. Nothing is wrong here.
   :feedback_b: Here we are simply creating a new instance of class B by calling the appropiate constructor. Nothing is wrong here.
   :feedback_c: Since class C is a subclass of class B, you can upcast an object of type C to be of type B.
   :feedback_d: This statement is creating a new object using the second constructor of the B class. This is also a valid way to create a B object.
   :feedback_e: Even though class C has a super class with a constructor that takes in a single int argument, class C does not have a constructor that takes an int value.

   Consider the following class declarations. Which of the following statements will not compile?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class B
      {

         public int myValue;

         public B()
         {
            myValue = 0;
         }

         public B(int x)
         {
            myValue = x;
         }
      }

      public class C extends B
      {

         public C()
         {
            super(0);
         }
      }
