   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: A subclass needs to specify its own constructors.
   :feedback_b: A subclass has the ability to add new methods and variables that are unique to it (meaning its parent class dosen't contain them)
   :feedback_c: Subclasses can overide public methods from their parent classes to specialize behavior.
   :feedback_d: Neither of these statements are true.
   :feedback_e: Statement III is correct, but not statement II.

   Consider the following class declarations. Which statements are true?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Animal
      {
       /* Some code */
      }

      public class Cat extends Animal
      {
         /* Some code */
      }

     I. Cat inherits the constructors of Animal
     II. Cat cannot add new methods and private instance variables that Animal does not have.
     III. Cat can override existing public methods of Animal
