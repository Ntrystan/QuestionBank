    :answer_a: Find the smallest element in arr and swap it into arr[0]
    :answer_b: Compare arr[0] with arr[1] and, if necessary, shift and replace elements such that arr[0] is less than arr[1]
    :answer_c: Compare arr[0] with the middle element of arr, arr[mid] , and if arr[0] is less than arr[mid] , swap these elements
    :answer_d: Compare the first and last elements, and if the first is less than the last, swap   these elements.
    :answer_e: Break the array into roughly two equal halves.
    :correct: e
    :feedback_a: This is for selection sort
    :feedback_b: This is for bubble sort
    :feedback_c: Merge sort deals with cutting sets into halves and repeating this process
    :feedback_d: Merge sort deals with cutting sets into halves and repeating this process
    :feedback_e: Firs step is to cut sets in halves until you get to a single element in a 'set'

    The elements of an array are to be sorted in increasing order. Which represent the first step of a merge sort algorithm?
