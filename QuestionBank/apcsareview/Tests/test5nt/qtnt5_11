      :answer_e: k
      :correct: c
      :feedback_a: k > 2 so will print out "SMALL"
      :feedback_b: k can be greater than 3
      :feedback_c: max of k-1 iterations (end - start + 1 is k - 2 + 1)
      :feedback_d: it is <= k so inclusive of k
      :feedback_e: max of k -1 iterations

      Consider the folllowing code segment. Assume ``k`` is some positive integer greater than 2. How many times will "SMALL" be printed?

      .. code-block:: Java

        for(int i = 2; i <= k; i++)
        {
            if(arr[i] < someValue)
                System.out.print("SMALL");
        }
