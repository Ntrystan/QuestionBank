  Suppose methods ``f1`` and ``f2`` are defined as follows. What value is returned from the call ``f1(5)``?

  .. code-block:: java

    public int f1(int x)
    {
        if(x == 0)
            return 0;
        else
            return f2(x -2);
    }

    public int f2(int x)
    {
        if(x == 1)
            return 1;
        else
            return f1(x + 1) + x;
    }
