   :answer_a: 2^24 numbers, 2^23-1 is the largest number
   :answer_b: 2^24 numbers, 2^24-1 is the largest number
   :answer_c: 2^23 numbers, 2^23 is the largest number
   :answer_d: 2^23 numbers, 2^23-1 is the largest number
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct!
   :feedback_b: There are 24 bits so there are 2^24 numbers, regardless if one is used for sign (half numbers are negative). For positive numbers, we only have 23 bits to represent, so 2^23-1 will be the largest.

   How many numbers can you represent with 4 bytes if one bit is used for a sign? What is the largest number you can represent?
