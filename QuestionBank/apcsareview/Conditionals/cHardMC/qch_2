   :answer_a: s == (m - 5) && (2 * s + 3) == (m + 3)
   :answer_b: (s == m - 5) && (s - 3 == 2 * (m - 3))
   :answer_c: (s == (m + 5)) && ((s + 3) == (2 * m + 3))
   :answer_d: s == m + 5 && s + 3 == 2 * m + 6
   :answer_e: None of the above is correct.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This can't be right because Susan is 5 years older than Matt, so the first part is wrong. It has Susan equal to Matt's age minus 5, which would have Matt older than Susan.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if Susan was 5 years younger than Matt and three years ago she was twice his age. But, how could she be younger than him now and twice his age three years ago?
   :feedback_c: This is almost right. It has Susan as 5 years older than Matt now. But the second part is wrong. Multiplication will be done before addition so (2 * m + 3) won't be correct, for in 3 years Susan will be twice as old as Matt. It should be (2 * (m + 3)) or (2 * m + 6)
   :feedback_d: Susan is 5 years older than Matt so s == m + 5 should be true and in 3 years she will be twice as old, so s + 3 = 2 * (m + 3) = 2 * m + 6
   :feedback_e: s == m + 5 && s + 3 == 2 * m + 6 is correct

   Susan is 5 years older than Matt. Three years from now Susan's age will be twice Matt's age. What should be in place of the following condition to solve this problem?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int s = 1; s <=100; s++) {
        for (int m = 1; m <= 100; m++) {
           if (condition)
              System.out.println("Susan is " + s + " and Matt is " + m);
        }
     }
