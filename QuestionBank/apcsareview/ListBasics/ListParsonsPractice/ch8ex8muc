   The following program segment should be method that removes all the Strings that have length 3 or shorter from an ArrayList of Strings (the parameter) -- so {"catch", "dog", "tree", "me"} should return {"catch", "tree"}.  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed code from the left to the right and put them in order with the correct indention so that the code would work correctly.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
