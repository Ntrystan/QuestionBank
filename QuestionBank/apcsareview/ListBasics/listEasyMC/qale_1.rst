   :feedback_a: You can't use length on lists and the last index is one less than the size.
   :feedback_b: You can't use length on lists, use size instead.
   :feedback_c: Since the first element in a list is at index 0 the last element is at the size minus 1.
   :feedback_d: The last element is at the size of the list minus 1.

   Which index is the last element in a list called ``nums`` at?
