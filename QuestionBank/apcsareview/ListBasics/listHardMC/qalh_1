   :feedback_a: The remove(1) removes the item at index 1 which will be 5 after the 4 is added at index 0.
   :feedback_b: The add(6) adds the 6 at the end of the list. The add(0,4) will add 4 at index 0. The remove(1) removes the 5 at index 1.
   :feedback_c: The remove(1) doesn't remove the 1, it removes the value at index 1.
   :feedback_d: The 5 will be removed with the remove(1).
   :feedback_e: This would be true if remove(1) removed the item with that value, but it removes the item at that index.
