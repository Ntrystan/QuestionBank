   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was mystery(5).
   :feedback_b: How can this be?  The value 0 is never returned.
   :feedback_c: Did you notice the recursive call?
   :feedback_d: This is the same as 3 to the 4th power (3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81).
   :feedback_e: This would be true if it was mystery(3).

   Condsider the following method.  What value is returned from a call of mystery(4)?

           return 1;
        else
           return 3 * mystery (n - 1);
     }
