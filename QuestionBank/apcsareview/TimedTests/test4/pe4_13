   :answer_a: Book b = new Book();
   :answer_b: Dictionary d = new Book();
   :answer_c: Comparable c = new Book();
   :answer_d: Book b = new Dictionary ();
   :answer_e: Comparable c = new Dictionary();
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: A object can always be declared to be of the type of the class that creates it.
   :feedback_b: The declared type must the the type of the class that creates the object or the type of any parent class.   Dictionary is not a parent of the Book class.
   :feedback_c: An object can be declared to be of an interface type if the interface type is one of the parent classes of the actual type.
   :feedback_d: The declared type can be the actual type (the class that creates the object) or any parent of the actual type.
   :feedback_e: Since Dictionary inherits from Book and Book implements the Comparable interface, this is allowed.

   Given the following class declarations, which declaration below will result in a compiler error?

   .. code-block:: java

     public class Book implements Comparable
     {
        // code for class
     }

     public class Dictionary extends Book
     {
        // code for class
     }
