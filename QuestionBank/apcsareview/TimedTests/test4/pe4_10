   :feedback_a: This will only print if both num1 and num2 are greater than 0 and num1 is greater than num2.
   :feedback_b: This will only print if both num1 and num2 are greater than 0 and num1 is equal to or less than num2.
   :feedback_c: This will only print if both num1 and num2 are less than 0.
   :feedback_d: This will only print if num2 is less than 0 and num1 is greater than or equal to 0.
   :feedback_e: The first test will fail since num1 is less than 0, the second test will fail since num2 is greater than 0, the third test will also fail since num2 is greater than 0, which leads to the else being executed.

   Consider the following method.   What is the output from conditionTest(-3,2)?

   .. code-block:: java

     public static void conditionTest(int num1, int num2)
     {
        if ((num1 > 0) && (num2 > 0))
        {
           if (num1 > num2)
              System.out.println("A");
           else
              System.out.println("B");
        }
        else if ((num2 < 0) && (num1 < 0)) {
           System.out.println("C");
        }
        else if (num2 < 0) {
           System.out.println("D");
        }
        else {
           System.out.println("E");
        }
     }
