   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was <code>return(a[1]*= 2);</code>.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the return statement was <code>return (a[0]*=2);</code>.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was <code>a[0]--;</code>  Or it would be true if array indicies started at 1, but they start with 0.
   :feedback_d: The statement <code>a[1]--;</code> is the same as <code>a[1] = a[1] - 1;</code> so this will change the 3 to a 2.  The return <code>(a[1] * 2)</code> does not change the value at <code>a[1]</code>.
   :feedback_e: This can't be true because <code>a[1]--;</code> means the same as <code>a[1] = a[1] - 1;</code>  So the 3 will become a 2.  Parameters are all pass by value in Java which means that a copy of the value is passed to a method.  But, since an array is an object a copy of the value is a copy of the reference to the object.  So changes to objects in methods are permanent.

   Consider the following method and if ``int[] a = {8, 3, 1}``, what is the value in ``a[1]`` after ``m1(a);`` is run?

   .. code-block:: java

      public int m1(int[] a)
      {
         a[1]--;
         return (a[1] * 2);
      }
