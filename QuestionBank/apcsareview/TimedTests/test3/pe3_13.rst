   :answer_a: Mirrors the values from the top half to the bottom half of the 2D array
   :answer_b: Mirrors the values from the left halt to the right half of the 2D array
   :answer_c: Mirrors the values from the bottom half to the top half of the 2D array
   :answer_d: Mirrors the values from the right half to the left half of the 2D array
   :answer_e: All values remain the same.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was p[height - row - 1][col] = p[row][col];
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was looping through all the rows and half the columns and copying from p[row][width - col - 1] = p[row][col];
   :feedback_c: This loops through the top half rows (height / 2) and mirrors the values from the bottom half p[row][col] = p[height - row - 1][col];  So p[0][0] = p[height - 1][0] and p[0][1] = p[height - 1][1].
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was looping through all the rows and half the columns and copying from p[row][width - col - 1] = p[row][col];
   :feedback_e: How can this be true since p[row][col] = p[height - row - 1][col]?

   Which of the following best explains what the method m does?

   .. code-block:: java

      public void m(int[][]p)
      {
         int height = p.length;
         for (int row = 0; row < height / 2; row++)
         {
            for (int col = 0; col <p[0].length; col++)
            {
               p[row][col] = p[height - row - 1][col];
            }
         }
      }
