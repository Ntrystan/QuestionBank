   :feedback_a: Is a Classroom a type of Building?  Don't use extends unless an object of the child class can be substituted for a object of the parent class.
   :feedback_b: If a classroom is a room, then Classroom should extend Room (inherit from it).  If a Building has rooms it should have a field that holds them.  Since a Building can have more than one Room we can use an array to hold the rooms.
   :feedback_c: Is a Room a type of Building?  Don't use extends unless the child is the same type of thing as the parent.
   :feedback_d: You can't extend two classes in Java so this can't be right.
   :feedback_e: You can't extend two classes in Java so this can't be right.
