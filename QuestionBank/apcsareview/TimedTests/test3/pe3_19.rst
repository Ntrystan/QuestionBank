   :answer_c: 14, 28
   :answer_d: 14, 29
   :answer_e: 1, 28
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: It will print the value of t before changing it, so it will print 13 first and the loop ends when t is equal to 29 so the last time it will print 28.
   :feedback_b: It prints the value of t before changing it and the loop ends when t equals 29 so how can this be true?
   :feedback_c: It prints the value of t before changing it and t starts at 13 so it will print 13 first.
   :feedback_d: It prints the value of t before changing it, so neither of these is correct.
   :feedback_e: How could it print 1 for the value of t when t is set to 13 initially?

   What are the first and last values output by the following code segment?

   .. code-block:: java

      int t = 13;
      while (t < 29)
      {
         System.out.println(t);
         t++;
      }
