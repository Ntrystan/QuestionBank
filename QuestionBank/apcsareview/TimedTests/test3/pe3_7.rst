   :answer_b: sporty.test(c,c);
   :answer_c: v.test(sporty,c);
   :answer_d: sporty.test(sporty,v);
   :answer_e: c.test(sporty,sporty);
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the test method took a SportsCar object and a Vehicle object.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the test method took two Car objects or a Car and a Vehicle object.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the test method took a SportsCar object and a Car object.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the test method took a SportsCar object and a Vehicle object.
   :feedback_e: The test method takes a Car object and a SportsCar object.  Only this answer correctly passes a SportsCar object as the second parameter.  You can use a SportsCar object as a Car object since it is a subclass of Car.  The test method can be called on any child of Vehicle.

   Which of the following is a correct call to test?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Vehicle {
         public void test(Car x, SportsCar y) {}
      }

      public class Car extends Vehicle {
      }

      public class SportsCar extends Car {
      }

      public class VechicleTest
      {
         public static void main(String[] args)
         {
            Vechicle v = new Vechicle();
            Car c = new Car();
            SportsCar sporty = new SportsCar();
         }
      }
