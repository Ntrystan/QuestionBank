   :feedback_a: This is the number of times that 5 goes into 19, but % is the remainder.
   :feedback_b: This would only be true if the first number was evenly divisible by the second number.
   :feedback_c: 5 goes into 19 3 times (15) with a remainder of 4 (19-15=4)
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if it was 19 % 2, but here we are dividing by 5.
