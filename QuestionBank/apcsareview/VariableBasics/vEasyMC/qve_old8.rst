   :feedback_a: To convert from binary to hexadecimal (base 16) convert groups of 4 bits from the right to the left to hexadecimal.  The rightmost 4 bits is 0100 which is 4 in hex.  The leftmost 4 bits would be 0011 which is 3 in hex.
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if the question had asked for the value in decimal, but it asked for it in hexadecimal (base 16).
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if the question had asked for the value in octal, but it asked for it in hexadecimal (base 16).
   :feedback_d: This is the length of this binary number.  Can you convert it to hexadecimal (base 16)?
   :feedback_e: This would be correct if the binary number was 10110100 instead of 110100.

   What is the hexadecimal equivalent of the following binary number: 110100?
