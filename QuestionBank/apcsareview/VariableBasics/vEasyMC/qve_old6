   :feedback_a: To convert from binary to decimal use the powers of 2 starting with 2 raised to the 0 power which is 1.  So 1001011 is 1 + 2 + 8 + 64 = 75.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the binary number was 1000011.  This would be 1 + 2 + 64 = 67.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if we started at the right hand side with 2, but we start with 1 (2 raised to the 0 power is 1).
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the binary number was 101011.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if the binary number was 1001010.

   Which of the following is the decimal value for the binary number 1001011?
