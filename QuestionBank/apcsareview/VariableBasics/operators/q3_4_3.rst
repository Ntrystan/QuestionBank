   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.
   :feedback_b: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.
   :feedback_c: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.
   :feedback_d: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.
   :feedback_e: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.

   What are the values of x, y, and z after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     int x = 0;
     int y = 1;
     int z = 2;
     x--; // x followed bythe double minus sign
     y++;
     z+=y;
