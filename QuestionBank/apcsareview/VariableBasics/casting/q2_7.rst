   :feedback_a: This does integer division before casting the result to double so it loses the fractional part.
   :feedback_b: When you divide an integer by an integer you get an integer result and lose the fractional part.
   :feedback_c: This will convert total to a double value and then divide by 3 to return a double result.

   Which of the following returns the correct average when 3 values had been added to an integer total?
