   Fill in the following: [blank] age = [blank]; to declare age to be an integer and set its value to 5.

   -    :int: Correct.  You typically use whole numbers for ages after age 1.
        :.*: Remember that Java uses just the first 3 letters of integer
   -    :5: Correct.  You can initialize to a value.
