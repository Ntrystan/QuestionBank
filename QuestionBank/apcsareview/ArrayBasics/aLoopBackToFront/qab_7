   :feedback_a: The method will only return -1 if no value in the array is less than the passed value.
   :feedback_b: Check the starting index.   Is it correct?
   :feedback_c: Check the starting index.   Is it correct?
   :feedback_d: You can not start the index at the length of the array.  You must start at the length of the array minus one.  This is a common mistake.

   Given the following code segment what will be returned when you execute: getIndexLastSmaller(7);

   .. code-block:: java

      private int[ ] values = {-20, -15, 2, 8, 16, 33};

      public int getIndexLastSmaller(int compare)
      {
         for (int i = values.length; i >=0; i--)
         {
            if (values[i] < compare) return i;
         }
         return -1; // to show none found
      }
