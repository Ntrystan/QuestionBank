   :answer_a: All values in positions <i>m+1</i> through <i>myStuff.length-1</i> are greater than or equal to <i>n</i>.
   :answer_b: All values in position 0 through <i>m</i> are less than <i>n</i>.
   :answer_c: All values in position <i>m+1</i> through <i>myStuff.length-1</i> are less than <i>n</i>.
   :answer_d: The smallest value is at position <i>m</i>.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Mystery steps backwards through the array until the first value less than the passed num (<i>n</i>) is found and then it returns the index where this value is found.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if mystery looped forward through the array and returned when it found a value greater than the passed num (<i>n</i>).
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it returned when it found a value at the current index that was greater than num (<i>n</i>).
   :feedback_d: It returns the first time the condition is met so nothing is known about the values which are unchecked.

   Given the following field and method, which of the following best describes the contents of ``myStuff`` after (``int m = mystery(n);``) has been executed?

   .. code-block:: java

     // private field in the class
     private int[ ] myStuff;

     //precondition: myStuff contains
     //  integers in no particular order
     public int mystery(int num)
     {
        for (int k = myStuff.length - 1; k >= 0; k--)
        {
            if (myStuff[k] < num)
            {
               return k;
            }
        }

        return -1;
      }
