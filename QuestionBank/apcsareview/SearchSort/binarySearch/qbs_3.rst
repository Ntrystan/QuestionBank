   :feedback_a: It will first compare with the value at index 2 and then index 4 and then return 4.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if we were looking for 23.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if we were looking for 31.

   How many times would the while loop execute if you first do int[] arr = {2, 10, 23, 31, 55, 86} and then call  binarySearch(arr,55)?
