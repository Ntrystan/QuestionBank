   The following method should return the number of times "5" is an element in the passed-in array -- so {1, 5, 7, 14, 5} will return 2 (Note that when the method is called the index will always start off as 0).  But the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>two extra blocks</b> that are not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
