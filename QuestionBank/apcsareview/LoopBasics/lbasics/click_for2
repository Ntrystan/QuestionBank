    :question: Click on all the statements that are part of the body of the for loop.  If you make a mistake you can click on the statement again to unhighlight it.

    :feedback: Remember, the body of a loop is all the statements between the { and } after the for declaration or single statement following the for declaration if there are no {}.  Java doesn't require the body to be indented, but you should indent it to make it easier to see that the statements are part of the loop.
