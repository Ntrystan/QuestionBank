      :answer_a: first city name (reverse alphabetically), then temperature (lowest to highest)
      :answer_b: first temperature (highest to lowest), then city name (alphabetically)
      :answer_c: first city name (reverse alphabetically), then temperature (highest to lowest)
      :answer_d: first temperature (lowest to highest), then city name (alphabetically)
      :answer_e: first city name (alphabetically), then temperature (lowest to highest)
      :feedback_a: Correct! In this case, the reverse parameter will cause the city name to be sorted reverse alphabetically instead of alphabetically, and it will also negate the negative sign in front of the temperature.
      :feedback_b: The order of the tuple matters. The first item in the tuple is the first condition used to sort. Also, take note of the reverse parameter - what will it do in this instance?
      :feedback_c: Not quite - is the reverse parameter set to True? Has a negative sign been used in the key parameter? What happens when those are both used?
      :feedback_d: The order of the tuple matters. The first item in the tuple is the first condition used to sort.
      :feedback_e: Not quite, remember that by default, the sorted function will sort by alphabetical order, or lowest to highest. Is the reverse parameter set to True? Has a negative sign been used in the key parameter?
      :correct: a

      What how will the following data be sorted?

      .. code-block:: python

         weather = {'Reykjavik': {'temp':60, 'condition': 'rainy'},
                    'Buenos Aires': {'temp': 55, 'condition': 'cloudy'},
                    'Cairo': {'temp': 96, 'condition': 'sunny'},
                    'Berlin': {'temp': 89, 'condition': 'sunny'},
                    'Caloocan': {'temp': 78, 'condition': 'sunny'}}

         sorted_weather = sorted(weather, key=lambda w: (w, -weather[w]['temp']), reverse=True)
