   What is the iterator (loop) variable in the following?
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    rest = ["sleep", 'dormir', 'dormire', "slaap", 'sen', 'yuxu', 'yanam']
    let = ''
    for phrase in rest:
        let += phrase[0]
   
   The iterator variable is
   
   -  :phrase: Good work!
      :rest: rest is the sequence, not the iterator variable.
      :let: let is the accumulator variable, not the iterator variable.
      :.*: Incorrect, try again.
