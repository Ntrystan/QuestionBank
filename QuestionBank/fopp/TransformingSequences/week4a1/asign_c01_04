   A palindrome is a phrase that, if reversed, would read the exact same. Write code that checks if ``p_phrase`` is a palindrome by reversing it and then checking if the reversed version is equal to the original. Assign the reversed version of ``p_phrase`` to the variable ``r_phrase`` so that we can check your work.

   p_phrase = "was it a car or a cat I saw"
