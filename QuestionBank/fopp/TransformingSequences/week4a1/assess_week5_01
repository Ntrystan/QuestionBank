   Currently there is a string called ``str1``. Write code to create a list called ``chars`` which should contain the characters from ``str1``. Each character in ``str1`` should be its own element in the list ``chars``.
   ~~~~
   str1 = "I love python"
   # HINT: what's the accumulator? That should go here.
