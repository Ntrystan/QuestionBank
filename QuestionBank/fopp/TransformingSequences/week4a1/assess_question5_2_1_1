   :answer_b: II.
   :answer_c: III.
   :answer_d: none of the above would be appropriate for the problem.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This pattern will only count how many items are in the list, not provide the total accumulated value.
   :feedback_b: This would reset the value of s each time the for loop iterated, and so by the end s would be assigned the value of the last item in the list plus the last item in the list.
   :feedback_c: Yes, this will solve the problem.
   :feedback_d: One of the patterns above is a correct way to solve the problem.

   Given that we want to accumulate the total sum of a list of numbers, which of the following accumulator patterns would be appropriate?

   I.

   .. sourcecode:: python

    nums = [4, 5, 2, 93, 3, 5]
    s = 0
    for n in nums:
        s = s + 1

   II.

   .. sourcecode:: python

    nums = [4, 5, 2, 93, 3, 5]
    s = 0
    for n in nums:
        s = n + n

   III.

   .. sourcecode:: python

    nums = [4, 5, 2, 93, 3, 5]
    s = 0
    for n in nums:
        s = s + n
