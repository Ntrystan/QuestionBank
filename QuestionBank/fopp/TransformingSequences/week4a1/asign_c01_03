   Write code that uses the string stored in ``sent`` and creates an acronym which is assigned to the variable ``acro``. The first two letters of each word should be used, each letter in the acronym should be a capital letter, and each element of the acronym should be separated by a ". " (dot and space). Words that should not be included in the acronym are stored in the list ``stopwords``. For example, if ``sent`` was assigned the string "height and ewok wonder" then the resulting acronym should be "HE. EW. WO".
   ~~~~
   stopwords = ['to', 'a', 'for', 'by', 'an', 'am', 'the', 'so', 'it', 'and', 'The']
   sent = "The water earth and air are vital"
