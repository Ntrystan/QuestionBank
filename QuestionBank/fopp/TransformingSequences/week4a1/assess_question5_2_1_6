   :answer_b: accumulator variable: total | iterator variable: s | sequence variable: lst
   :answer_c: accumulator variable: x | iterator variable: sentences | sequence variable: sentence_lst
   :answer_d: accumulator variable: total | iterator variable: sentence |sequence variable: sentence_lst
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Though lst is an acceptable name, x and s are not informative names for accumulator and iterator variables.
   :feedback_b: Though total is great and lst is an acceptable name, s is a little bit cryptic as a variable name referring to a sentence.
   :feedback_c: Though sentence_lst is a good name, the iterator variable should be singular rather than plural, and x is not an informative name for the accumulator variable.
   :feedback_d: Yes, this combination of variable names is the clearest.
   :feedback_e: One of the options above has good names for the scenario.

   Given the following scenario, what are good names for the accumulator variable, iterator variable, and sequence variable? You are writing code that uses a list of sentences and accumulates the total number of sentences that have the word 'happy' in them.
