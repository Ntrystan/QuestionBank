   :feedback_a: No, though sum might be clear, it is also the name of a commonly used function in Python, and so there can be issues if sum is used as an accumulator variable.
   :feedback_b: No, x is not a clear enough name to be used for an accumulator variable.
   :feedback_c: Yes, total is a good name for accumulating numbers.
   :feedback_d: Yes, accum is a good name. It's both short and easy to remember.
   :feedback_e: At least one of the answers above is a good name for an accumulator variable.
