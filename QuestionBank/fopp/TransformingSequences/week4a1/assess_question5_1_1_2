   :feedback_a: Yes, this is the sequence that we iterate over.
   :feedback_b: This is the iterator variable. It changes each time but is not the whole sequence itself.
   :feedback_c: This is the accumulator variable. By the end of the program, it will have a full count of how many items are in cawdra.
