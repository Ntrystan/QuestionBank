   :answer_a: Accumulator Variable: total_so_far        ; Iterator Variable: seat
   :answer_b: Accumulator Variable: total_seats_so_far  ; Iterator Variable: seat_count
   :answer_c: Accumulator Variable: count               ; Iterator Variable: n
   :feedback_a: Though the accumulator variable is good, the iterator variable is not clear enough.
   :feedback_b: Yes, this is the most clear combination.
   :feedback_c: Neither the accumulator nor iterator variable are clear enough. The accumulator variable is better, but could be more clear.

   Which of these are good alternatives to the accumulator variable and iterator variable names for the following prompt? Write code to sum up all of the numbers in the list ``seat_counts``. Store that number in the variable ``total_seat_counts``.
