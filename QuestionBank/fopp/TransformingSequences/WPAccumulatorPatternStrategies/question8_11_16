   :answer_b: Accumulator Variable: no variable needed  ; Iterator Variable: c
   :answer_c: Accumulator Variable: no variable needed  ; Iterator Variable: char
   :feedback_a: Incorrect, there is no accumulator variable neccessary
   :feedback_b: Though no accumulator variable is needed, the iterator variable is not clear enough
   :feedback_c: Yes, there is no accumulator variable needed and the iterator variable is clear (char is a common short form of character)
