   :answer_a: Accumulator Variable: total_so_far        ; Iterator Variable: seat
   :answer_b: Accumulator Variable: total_seats_so_far  ; Iterator Variable: seat_count
   :answer_c: Accumulator Variable: count               ; Iterator Variable: n
   :feedback_a: Though the accumulator variable is good, the iterator variable is not clear enough.
   :feedback_b: Yes, this is the most clear combination.
   :feedback_c: Neither the accumulator nor iterator variable are clear enough. The accumulator variable is better, but could be more clear.
   :correct: b
   :practice: T

   Which of these are good alternatives to the accumulator variable and iterator variable names for the following prompt? Write code to sum up all of the numbers in the list ``seat_counts``. Store that number in the variable ``total_seat_counts``.
