    img = image.Image("http://reputablejournal.com/images/ComputerHistory/TeleType.png")
    win = image.ImageWin(img.getWidth(), img.getHeight())
    img.draw(win)
    img.setDelay(1, 15)    # slow enough so that we can see the process

    # do not modify the code above this line

    # write code HERE that will transform the image 
    # as described in the instructions above
