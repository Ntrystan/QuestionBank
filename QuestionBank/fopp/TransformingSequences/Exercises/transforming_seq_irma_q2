   :answer_b: Nothing. There's an error.
   :answer_c: ["holiday", "celebrate"]
   :feedback_a: This is true. It is called aliasing (Section 9.5).
   :feedback_b: There is no error in this code. Please check Section 9.5 (Aliasing)
   :to: understand why not.
   :feedback_c: That's incorrect. What we used here is something called
   :aliasing.: Both a and b variables refer to the same list. So
   :either: you append to a or b, you append to the same list.
   :correct: a
