   :answer_a: ["holiday", "celebrate", "company"]
   :answer_b: Nothing. There's an error.
   :answer_c: ["holiday", "celebrate"]
   :feedback_a: This is true. It is called aliasing (Section 9.5).
   :feedback_b: There is no error in this code. Please check Section 9.5 (Aliasing)
                to understand why not. 
   :feedback_c: That's incorrect. What we used here is something called
                aliasing. Both a and b variables refer to the same list. So
                either you append to a or b, you append to the same list.
   :correct: a
