   :answer_a: We are Siamese if you please. We are Siamese if you don’t please.
   :answer_b: Error
   :answer_c: Pumpkin
   :answer_d: Nothing. There’s no print statement.
   :feedback_a: You cannot invoke methods defined in the Siamese class on an instance of the Cheshire class. Both are subclasses of Cat, but Cheshire is not a subclass of Siamese, so it doesn't inherit its methods.
   :feedback_b: You cannot invoke methods defined in the Siamese class on an instance of the Cheshire class. Both are subclasses of Cat, but Cheshire is not a subclass of Siamese, so it doesn't inherit its methods.
   :feedback_c: This would print if the statement was print new_cat.name.
   :feedback_d: There is a print statement in the method definition for Siamese.

   What would print after running the following code:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
     new_cat = Cheshire("Pumpkin”)
     class Siamese(Cat):
       def song(self):
         print("We are Siamese if you please. We are Siamese if you don’t please.")
     another_cat = Siamese("Lady")
     new_cat.song()
