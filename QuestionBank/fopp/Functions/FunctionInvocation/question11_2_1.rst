   :answer_a: A named sequence of statements.
   :answer_b: Any sequence of statements.
   :answer_c: A mathematical expression that calculates a value.
   :answer_d: A statement of the form x = 5 + 4.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, a function is a named sequence of statements.
   :feedback_b: While functions contain sequences of statements, not all sequences of statements are considered functions.
   :feedback_c: While some functions do calculate values, the python idea of a function is slightly different from the mathematical idea of a function in that not all functions calculate values.  Consider, for example, the turtle functions in this section.   They made the turtle draw a specific shape, rather than calculating a value.
   :feedback_d: This statement is called an assignment statement.  It assigns the value on the right (9), to the name on the left (x).
