    Write a function named ``merge_strings`` that takes two
    parameters, both strings, and merges them into one,
    alternating the characters. For example, if ``merge_strings``
    is called with the actual parameters ``"abc"`` and ``"123"``,
    ``merge_strings`` should return ``"a1b2c3"``. If the function
    ``merge_strings`` is called with strings that aren't the
    same length, then it should print the error message
    ``"Strings must be the same length"`` and return the empty
    string.
