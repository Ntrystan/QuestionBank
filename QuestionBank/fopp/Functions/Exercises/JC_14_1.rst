   Write a function that removes all occurrences of a given letter from a string. Test your code with the following text: "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked. If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?" by removing all "p" and "P".
   ~~~~
   tong_twister='Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked. If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?'
   def remove_letter(theLetter, theString):
       # your code here
   
   
   
   print(remove_letter('p',tong_twister)) #This should remove all upper and lower case p.
