    *(5 points)* Complete your solution to Problem 1 in the ActiveCode box below.  I have provided a main program that will test your function--do *not* make any changes to my code.  (You may define additional functions if you wish; but that is not required.)

    # your function tmit goes ABOVE this line
    # do NOT change anything BELOW this line

    # should print "tmit of listOne = 5.02833333333"
    listOne = [2.76, 6.34, 0.84, 6.7, 0.47, 5.75, 7.78, 8.54]
    print("tmit of listOne = ", 
           tmit(listOne))

    # should print "tmit of listTwo = 3.85"
    listTwo = [1.2, 3.4, 4.3, 9.5]
    print("tmit of listTwo = ", 
           tmit(listTwo))
