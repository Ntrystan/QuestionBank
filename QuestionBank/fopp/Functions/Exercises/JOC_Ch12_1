   Write a function ``separate_types`` that takes a list with mixed type and divides it into sub lists by type. A list with sorted strings and a list with sorted numbers, and a list of lists (don't need to sort...). For example ['rat',8,'dog',10,11,[5],3,['cat']] would become [['dog','rat'],[3,8,10,11],[[5],['cat']].
