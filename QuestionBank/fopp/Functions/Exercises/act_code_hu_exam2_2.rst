    *(4 points)* Define a Python *function* named ``isOdd(num)`` that takes a single integer parameter *(num)* and then uses a `return` statement to return either Boolean value ``True`` or ``False``, based on whether that parameter is an odd or an even number.  Your function definition should **not** include any ``print`` statements.  Below your function definition, include a main program that nicely **prompts the user** to enter an integer, and then uses your function to determine whether or not that integer is odd or even.  Your main program should print that result with a nice message, for example, ``4 is even`` or ``9 is odd``.
