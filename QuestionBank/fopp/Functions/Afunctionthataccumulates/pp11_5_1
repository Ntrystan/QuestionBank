   Rearrange the code statements to match the activecode window above. (This is an exercise in noticing where the indenting and outdenting happens, and where the return statement goes.)

   def mylen(x):
   =====
       c = 0 # initialize count variable to 0
   =====
       for y in x:
   =====
           c = c + 1   # increment the counter for each item in x
   =====
       return c
   =====
   print(mylen("hello"))
   print(mylen([1, 2, 7]))
