   :feedback_a: This would try to open a file inside of Project (but that is not where the file is.)
   :feedback_b: This would go to the parent directory of Project and look for a subdirectory of that called CompanyData. But CompanyData is inside Project so it wouldn't be found.
   :feedback_c: Yes, this is how you can access the file!
   :feedback_d: This would try to find a subdirectory Project of the current directory called Project.
   :feedback_e: Remember that '..' will bring you up one level to the parent directory. This would try to open a csv file in the parent directory of Project (but that is not where the file is.)

   Say you are in a directory called Project. In it, you have a file with your Python code. You would like to read in data from a file called "YearlyProjections.csv" which is in a folder called CompanyData, which is inside of Project. What is the best way to open the file in your Python program?
