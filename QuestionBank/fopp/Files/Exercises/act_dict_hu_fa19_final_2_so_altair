    *(10 points)* Recall the Stack Overflow developer 
    survey file (``so_survey.csv``) from Chapter 11. 
    Write a Python program that reads that file, and then 
    uses the Altair module to produce a bar graph showing the 
    number of developers who report each level of 
    satisfaction *(e.g.* ``Extremely dissatisfied``, 
    ``Moderately satisfied,`` `etc).`  

    Place the satisfaction classifications on the X axis and 
    the number of developers on the Y axis.  
    You may wish to re-visit that
    `Textbook Project <https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/fopp/Projects/split_apply_combine.html>`_ section in the textbook, to review the format of the ``so_survey.csv`` file (**right-click** on the provided link and open it in a new browser tab).
