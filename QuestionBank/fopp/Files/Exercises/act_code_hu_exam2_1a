    *(4 points)* I have provided you with access to your author's file named ``emotion_words.txt``.  That file contains several lines with various words that describe emotions. Write a Python program that determines how many of those words are longer than 8 characters.  Your program should print that result as an *integer* on a single line.  It should produce **no** other output. Do **NOT** hard code the answer in your response.  For example, your program should output a number like ``9`` or ``23`` or ``12``, and nothing else.

    # Your program should end with a single
    # "print" statement that prints the value
    # of an integer variable on screen
    # (the number of words from the file
    # that are longer than 8 characters).
    # It should not print anything else.

    # your code goes below
