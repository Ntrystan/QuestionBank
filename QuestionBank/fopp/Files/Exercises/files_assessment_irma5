    Assume I have a file called ``names.txt`` containing the following:
   
   ``Peter Pan``
   
   ``Cinderella``
   
   ``Moana``
   
   Which of the code snippets below prints all the lines/names in this text file?
    
   
   ``I``
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    names = open("names.txt", "r")
    for line in names:
      print(names)
   
   ``II``
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    names = open("names.txt", "r")
    for line in names:
      print(line)
   
   ``III``
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
    names = open("names.txt", "r")
    for line in names:
      print("line")
