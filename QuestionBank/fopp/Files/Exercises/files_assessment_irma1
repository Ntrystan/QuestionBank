   :answer_c: infile = open("myText.txt", “w”)
   :feedback_a: Beware of variable name versus string value. Python will think myText.txt is a variable name here (which by the way is not a valid variable name). Check Note in 10.2
   :feedback_b: This is correct. We provide a string with file name + "r" which means read only.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect since "w" denotes writing, not readig.
