   **1.** Below we have provided two lists of numbers, ``L1`` and ``L2``. Using zip and list comprehension, create a new list, ``L3``, that sums the two numbers if the number from ``L1`` is greater than 10 and the number from ``L2`` is less than 5. This can be accomplished in one line of code.
   ~~~~

   L1 = [1, 5, 2, 16, 32, 3, 54, 8, 100]
   L2 = [1, 3, 10, 2, 42, 2, 3, 4, 3]
