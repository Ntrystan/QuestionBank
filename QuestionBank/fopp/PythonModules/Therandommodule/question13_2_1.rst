   :feedback_a: This will generate a number between 1 and 101, but does not include 101.
   :feedback_b: This will generate a number between 1 and 100, but does not include 100.  The highest value generated will be 99.
   :feedback_c: This will generate a number between 0 and 100.  The lowest value generated is 0.  The highest value generated will be 100.
   :feedback_d: This will generate a number between 0 and 100, but does not include 100.  The lowest value generated is 0 and the highest value generated will be 99.
