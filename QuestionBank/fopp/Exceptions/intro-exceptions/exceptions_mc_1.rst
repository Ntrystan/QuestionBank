   :feedback_a: Syntax errors are things like missing colons or strings that are not terminated. Try/except will not help with those. The program still will not run.
   :feedback_b: Run-time errors like index out of bounds can be caught and handled gracefully with try/except.
   :feedback_c: If your program runs to completion but does the wrong thing, try/except won't help you.
