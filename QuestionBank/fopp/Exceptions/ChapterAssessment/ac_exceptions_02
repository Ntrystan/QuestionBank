   The list, ``numb``, contains integers. Write code that populates the list ``remainder`` with the remainder of 36 divided by each number in ``numb``. For example, the first element should be 0, because 36/6 has no remainder. If there is an error, have the string "Error" appear in the ``remainder``.

   numb = [6, 0, 36, 8, 2, 36, 0, 12, 60, 0, 45, 0, 3, 23]
   
   remainder = []
