   Define a class called ``Bike`` that accepts a string and a float as
   input, and assigns those inputs respectively to two instance
   variables, ``color`` and ``price``. Assign to the variable
   ``testOne`` an instance of ``Bike`` whose color is **blue** and
   whose price is **89.99**. Assign to the variable ``testTwo`` an
   instance of Bike whose color is **purple** and whose price is
   **25.0**.
