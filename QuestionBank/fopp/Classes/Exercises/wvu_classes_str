    Add a **__str__()** function to the **Vehicle** class to return a string representation of object contents. Your function should return the vehicle's year, make, and model like "2015 Dodge Journey".

    Create an instance of the **Vehicle** class to represent a vehicle of your choice, and print your vehicle instance.

            self.year = year
            self.make = make
            self.model = model
