   Define a class called ``BankAccount`` that accepts the name you want associated with your bank account in a string, and an integer that represents the amount of money in the account. The constructor should initialize two instance variables from those inputs: ``name`` and ``amt``. Add a string method so that when you print an instance of ``BankAccount``, you see ``"Your account, [name goes here], has [start_amt goes here] dollars."`` Create an instance of this class with ``"Bob"`` as the name and ``100`` as the amount. Save this to the variable ``t1``.
