   Create a string representing a quote from the first black woman in
   space Mae Jemison. She said: "We look at science as something very
   elite, which only a few people can learn. That's just not true. You
   just have to start early and give kids a foundation. Kids live up,
   or down, to expectations." Now use the split function to split this
   quote into four pieces based on the occurrence of the period
   punctuation and print each piece in order and one at a time.
