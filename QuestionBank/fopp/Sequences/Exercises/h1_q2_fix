    :match_1: a = a + 1 ||| 4
    :match_2: print("a = a + 1") ||| 3
    :match_3: a -= 2||| 1
    :match_4: a = square(a)||| 9

    Assume that variable a is initialized to 3 with this line of code: a = 3. Match each piece of code on the left, to the right final value of 'a' on the right if you execute each of the expressions on the left independently.
