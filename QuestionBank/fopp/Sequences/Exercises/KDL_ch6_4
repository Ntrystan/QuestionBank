   The following code contains all the words to Dr. Seuss's `Green eggs and Ham`:
       1.Determine the number of times ``Sam`` shows up.
   
       2.Determine the number of times ``green`` shows up. 
   
       3.Determine the index of the first use of the word ``mouse``. 
   
       4.Determine the number of times ``I`` is used.
   
       5.Determine the location of the first use of ``here``.
   
       6.Replace exclamation points and question marks in ``greeneggs`` with periods.
   
       7.Split greeneggs at the periods and assign the list to ``greeneggssplit``.
