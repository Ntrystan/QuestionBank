    Given the list in activecode below use list indexing to print the type of the 4th element ('lights') and 7th element ('1') of ls1. Did you get what you expected? Did you expect '1' to be an integer? Now do the same for ls2. You notice that now you get a different result. Compare and analyze why.
    ~~~~
    ls1 = ['who', 'world', 'run', 'lights', '?', 'girls', '1', 'sea']
    #your code here
    #your code here
    ls2 = ['who', 'world', 'run', 'lights', '?', 'girls', 1, 'sea']
    #your code here
    #your code here
