   The **generate_list()** function should return a list with every integer between 1 and 10, including 1 and 10. The code has errors. Fix the errors so it works correctly.

   This question has no unit tests.

   def generate_list():
       num_list = []

       idx = 0
       while (idx < 10)
           num_list += idx

       return num_list
