   The final project is meant to showcase your mastery of Python and be semi-fun or informative.  Projects from previous classes  have included hangman,  a  Sudoku  solver,  a snake game  and  Yahtzee. We will spend much of the last few weeks of class working on this project. Part of your grade will be based on how difficult I believe the project is for you to complete. Your project should be easy enough that you can make progress on it without my constant help but...you should need to ask questions and it should take you a good chunk of time (2ish weeks) to complete. In the box provided tell me the goal of your project and what you feel the difficult will be. In many cases this will require you to look up the rules(or constraints). I will take your opinion on difficulty into account but the final decision is mine.
