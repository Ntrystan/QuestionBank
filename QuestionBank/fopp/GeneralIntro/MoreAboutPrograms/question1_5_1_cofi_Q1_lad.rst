   :answer_c: a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
   :answer_b: a special kind of notation used by programmers.
   :answer_a: a computation, even a symbolic computation.
   :answer_d: the same thing as an algorithm.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_c: It is just step-by-step instructions that the computer can understand and execute.  Programs often implement algorithms, but note that algorithms are typically less precise than programs and do not have to be written in a programming language.
   :feedback_b: Programmers sometimes use a special notation to illustrate or document an algorithm, but this is not the definition of a program.
   :feedback_a: A program can perform a computation, but by itself it is not one.
   :feedback_d: Programs often implement algorithms, but they are not the same thing.  An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions, but those instructions are not necessarily precise enough for a computer to follow.  A program must be written in a programming language that the computer knows how to interpret.
