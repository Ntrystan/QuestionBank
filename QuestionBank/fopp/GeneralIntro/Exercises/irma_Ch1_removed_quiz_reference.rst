   Assume you need to write a program to compute the total sale amount of a purchase including sales tax.  
   The formula in Idaho is the following: total = purchase + purchase * 0.06. That is, the total sale amount
   is the purchase amount plus 6% = 0.06 of the purchase amount. 
   Choose the right step sequence for the user to use your program.
   -----
   user inputs the total purchase price
   =====
   your program stores the provided value into a variable called purchase
   =====
   you create a variable called total_sale
   =====
   total_sale = purchase + purchase * 0.06
   =====
   output total_sale so that the user sees the result
   =====
