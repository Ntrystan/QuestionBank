   Assume you need to write a program to compute the total sale amount of a purchase including sales tax.  
   The formula in Idaho is the following: total = purchase + purchase * 0.06. That is, the total sale amount
   is the purchase amount plus 6% = 0.06 of the purchase amount. 
   Choose the right step sequence for the user to use your program. Note that your first Checked answer will be graded for the Quiz.
