        :feedback_a: Oh no. The value of a is now 7, the value of b is still 3, so what is a + b equal to?
        :feedback_b: Correct. c = a + b = 7 + 3  = 10
        :feedback_c: Oh no. The value of a is now 7, the value of b is still 3, so what is a + b equal to?

        Consider the following program you read top to bottom:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
         line 1: a = 2 
         line 2: b = 3 
         line 3: c = a + b 
        
        What would be the final value of `c` if the value for `a` is changed to 7.
