        :feedback_a: Correct! It's 5 because a is 2, b is 3 and a + b is 2 + 3 = 5.
        :feedback_b: Oh no. c is assigned the result of a + b.
        :feedback_c: Oh no. c is assigned the result of a + b.

        Consider the following problem:
        
        line 1: a = 2 (the value of a is 2)
        
        line 2: b = 3 (the value of b is 3)
        
        line 3: c = a + b (the value of c is a + b)
        
        Can you predict what could be the value of c in line 3?
