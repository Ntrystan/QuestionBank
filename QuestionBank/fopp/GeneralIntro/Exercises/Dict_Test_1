   **Dictionaries:** Write a program that accepts a string as an input and creates a dictionary that counts the number of times each letter is present in the string and is NOT case sensitive (i.e. ‘Aa’ would count as 2 a’s). The keys should be the letters and the values should be the number of times that letter is in the string. For example an input of  ‘aabbcAa’ would return {‘a’:4,’b’:2,’c’:1}.  The alphabet string is already provided for you.  (Hint: consider converting input string to lower case.)
