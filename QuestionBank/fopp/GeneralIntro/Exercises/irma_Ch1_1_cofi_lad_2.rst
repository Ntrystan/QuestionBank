        :feedback_b: Oh no. c is assigned the result of a * b.
        :feedback_c: Correct! It's 6 because a is 2, b is 3 and a * b is 2 * 3 = 6.

        Consider the following problem:
        
        line 1: a = 2 (the value of a is 2)
        
        line 2: b = 3 (the value of b is 3)
        
        line 3: c = a * b (the value of c is a * b)
        
        Predict the value of c in line 3.
