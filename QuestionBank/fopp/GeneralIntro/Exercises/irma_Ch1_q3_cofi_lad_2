   Assume you need to write a program to compute the sale price of an item which is advertised as 40% off.  
   The formula for the sale price is the following: sale price = original price * 0.6. That is, the sale price of the item
   is 60% of the original price or original price times 0.6. 
   Choose the right step sequence for the user to use your program. Note that your first Checked answer will be graded for the Quiz.
   -----
   user inputs the original price
   =====
   your program stores the provided value into a variable called original
   =====
   you create a variable called sale_price
   =====
   sale_price = original * 0.6
   =====
   output sale_price so that the user sees the result
