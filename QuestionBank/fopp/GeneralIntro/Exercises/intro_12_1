   :answer_a: Because computers are better at solving problems
   :answer_b: So that you don't have to solve the problem yourself
   :answer_c: So that you have a general solution to a problem
   :answer_d: Because you need a set of instructions to follow.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Computers aren't necessarily better at solving problems, though often they can be quicker than humans. Additionally, algorithms can be used to solve non-computer related problems.
   :feedback_b: While it is beneficial to have a set of instructions that others can follow, this isn't the best answer. By creating the algorithm, you solve a problem for yourself and others.
   :feedback_c: Yes, by creating a general solution you can then express it as a program if you choose, and then use a computer to automate the execution
   :feedback_d: While it is beneficial to have a set of instructions as that is what an algorithm **is**, it is not **why** we would want to create one.

   Why create an algorithm?
