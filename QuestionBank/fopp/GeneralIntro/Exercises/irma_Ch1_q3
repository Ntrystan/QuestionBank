   Assume you need to write a program to convert temperature expressed in Fahrenheit into Celsius degrees. The formula is the following: T(°C) = (T(°F) - 32) × 5/9. That is, temperature in Celsius is equal to the given temperature in Fahrenheit minus 32 and then multiplied by 5/9. Choose the right step sequence for the user to use your program.
   -----
   user inputs temperature in Fahrenheit
   =====
   your program stores the provided value into a variable called Fahr
   =====
   you create a variable called Cels
   =====
   Cels = (Fahr - 32) × 5/9.
   =====
   output Cels so that the user sees the result
   =====
