        :feedback_a: Look a bit more carefully. Python prints the value of the variable called `last_name`. What is the value of `last_name` in the program?
        :feedback_b: Look a bit more carefully. Python prints the value of the variable called `last_name`. What is the value of `last_name` in the program?
        :feedback_c: Correct! It will print whatever value the variable `last_name` holds, and that is `Boone`.

        Consider the following program you read line by line, top to bottom:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
         line 1: first_name = "William"
         line 2: middle_name = "Judson"
         line 3: last_name = "Boone"
         line 4: print(last_name)
        
        Python will execute the program starting from line 1, to line 2, to line 3 and then to line 4 (top to bottom). Since there is no more code
        it will stop. What will Python print on your console when it executes the final line (line 4)?
