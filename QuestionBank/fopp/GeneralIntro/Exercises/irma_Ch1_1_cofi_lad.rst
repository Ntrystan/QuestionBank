        :feedback_a: Correct! It's 1 because a is 2, b is 3 and b - a is 3 - 2 = 1.
        :feedback_b: Oh no. c is assigned the result of b - a.
        :feedback_c: Oh no. c is assigned the result of b - a.

        Consider the following problem:
        
        line 1: a = 2 (the value of a is 2)
        
        line 2: b = 3 (the value of b is 3)
        
        line 3: c = b - a (the value of c is b - a)
        
        Predict the value of c in line 3.
