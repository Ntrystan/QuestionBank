        :answer_b: Hermione
        :feedback_a: Correct! It will print whatever value the variable `my_name` holds, and that is `Harry`.
        :feedback_b: Look a bit more careful. Python prints the value of the variable called `my_name`. What is the value of `my_name` in the program?

        Consider the following program you read line by line, top to bottom:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
         line 1: my_name = "Harry"
         line 2: your_name = "Hermione"
         line 3: print(my_name)
        
        Python will execute the program starting from line 1, to line 2 and then to line 3 (top to bottom). Since there is no more code
        it will stop. What will Python print on your console when it executes the final line (line 3)?
