   :answer_a: It is high-level if you are standing and low-level if you are sitting.
   :answer_b: It is high-level if you are programming for a computer and low-level if you are programming for a phone or mobile device.
   :answer_c: It is high-level if the program must be processed before it can run, and low-level if the computer can execute it without additional processing.
   :answer_d: It is high-level if it easy to program in and is very short; it is low-level if it is really hard to program in and the programs are really long.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: In this case high and low have nothing to do with altitude.
   :feedback_b: High and low have nothing to do with the type of device you are programming for.  Instead, look at what it takes to run the program written in the language.
   :feedback_c: Python is a high level language but must be interpreted into machine code (binary) before it can be executed.
   :feedback_d: While it is true that it is generally easier to program in a high-level language and programs written in a high-level language are usually shorter, this is not always the case.
