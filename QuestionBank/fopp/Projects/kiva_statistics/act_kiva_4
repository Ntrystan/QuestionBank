    Store the amount of the minimum loan in  ``min_loan`` and the amount of the maximum loan in ``max_loan`` Then, store the name of the country that received the largest loan in ``max_country`` and the smallest loan in ``min_country``  Hint: ``max`` and ``min`` are built in Python functions that you can use to find the minimum value or maximum value in any sequence.
