    Recall the Stack Overflow developer survey file (``so_survey.csv``). Write a Python program that reads that file, and then uses the Altair module to produce a bar graph showing the number of developers who report each level of satisfaction `(e.g.` "Extremely dissatisfied," "Moderately satisfied," `etc).`  Place the satisfaction classifications on the X axis and the number of developers on the Y axis.  (You may wish to and re-visit `Section 11.4 <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/heidelberg_ac101f18/Dictionaries/split_apply_combine.html>`_ of the textbook, to review the format of the ``so_survey.csv`` file (**right-click** on the provided link and open it in a new browser tab).
