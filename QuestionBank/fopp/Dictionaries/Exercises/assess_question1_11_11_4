    Consider the following function:
    
    .. sourcecode:: python
    
        alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
        values = {}
        for i in range(len(alphabet)):
            values[alphabet[i]] = i+1;
        answer  = 0
        for c in s:
            answer += values[c]
        return answer
    
    When the ``foo()`` is called with the input "baa", what value does it return? (Write "error" if you think it would raise an error instead.)
    
    -   :4: Good Work!
        :error: The code is valid.
        :.*: Incorrect, try again. (*Hint:* Lookup value of each character of "baa" in ``values``.)
