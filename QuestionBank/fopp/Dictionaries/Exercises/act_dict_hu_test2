    Recall the Stack Overflow developer survey file (``so_survey.csv``). Write a Python program that reads that file, and then uses Altair to produce a bar graph indicating the number of developers who report each level of satisfaction.  Consult your paper instruction sheet for a picture of a sample bar chart that was generated in response to this question.
