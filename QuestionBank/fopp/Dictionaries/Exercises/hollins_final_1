    The variable ``pi`` on line 1 is a string that shows the 
    number pi with many digits of accuracy. Write a program to
    create a dictionary with the digits as keys and their counts
    as values. The dictionary should not contain the decimal
    point as a key, and the keys should be stored as integers.
    (You must use a for loop to create the dictionary, as usual;
    that is, you cannot count digits yourself and then define
    a dictionary by hard-coding it.)
    Once you have created the dictionary, print the results
    as follows:

    ``The digit 0 has count 1``

    ``The digit 1 has count 5``

    ``...``

    You need not worry about sorting when you print -- whatever
    order results by default is fine.
