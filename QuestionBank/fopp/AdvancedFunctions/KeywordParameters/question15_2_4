   :answer_d: Runtime error since two different values are provided for initial.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: 2 is bound to x, no z
   :feedback_b: the default value for z is determined at the time the function is defined; at that time initial has the value 7.
   :feedback_c: the default value for z is determined at the time the function is defined, not when it is invoked.
   :feedback_d: there's nothing wrong with reassigning the value of a variable at a later time.

   What value will be printed for z?

   .. code-block:: python

      initial = 7
      def f(x, y = 3, z = initial):
          print ("x, y, z are:", x, y, z)
      initial = 0
      f(2)
