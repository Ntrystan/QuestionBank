   :feedback_a: This does not use the turtle method necessary to move a turtle backward. Additionally, how would the program know what turtle should be moving?
   :feedback_b: This does not use the turtle method necessary to move a turtle backward. Additionally, how would the program know what turtle should be moving?
   :feedback_c: This is a correct way to move a turtle backward.
   :feedback_d: This is not the correct structure to execute the task.
   :feedback_e: You are allowed to write expressions inside of methods, so this is correctly written.
