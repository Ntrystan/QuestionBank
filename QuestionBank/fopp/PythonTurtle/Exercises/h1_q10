   Consider the program below which prints ``I love Python`` 
   10 times. To avoid hard-coding, change this program 
   so that it asks a user for an input that specifies how many 
   times ``I love Python`` should be printed. So if the user says 
   ``3`` times, the program will print it ``3`` times. It should work for 
   any input without you manually changing the code.
