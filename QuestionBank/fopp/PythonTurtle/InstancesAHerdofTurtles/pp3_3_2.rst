   The following program has one turtle, "jamal", draw a line to the north in blue and then another, "tina", draw a line to the east in orange as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/TwoTurtlesL.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" alt="image of a line to the north in blue color drawn by one Turtle and a line to the east in orange drawn by another Turtle. Both the Turtles have a same starting point."/>. The program should import the turtle module, get the window to draw on, create the turtle "jamal", have it draw a line to the north, then create the turtle "tina", and have it draw a line to the east. Finally, it should set the window to close when the user clicks in it.<br /><br /><p>Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order. Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order.</p>
