   The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital T in white on a green background as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/TurtleT.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" alt="image of a letter T drawn by Turtle."/> but the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, and set the pen size to 10. After that the turtle should turn to face north, draw a line that is 150 pixels long, turn to face west, and draw a line that is 50 pixels long. Next, the turtle should turn 180 degrees and draw a line that is 100 pixels long. Finally, set the window to close when the user clicks in it.<br /><br /><p>Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order. Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order.</p>
