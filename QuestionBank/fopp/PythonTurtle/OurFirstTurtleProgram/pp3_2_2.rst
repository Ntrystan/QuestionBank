   The following program uses a turtle to draw a checkmark as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/TurtleCheckmark4.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" alt="image of a navigational compass and a checkmark which is drawn by Turtle."/> but the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up: import the turtle module, get the window to draw on, and create the turtle. The turtle should turn to face southeast, draw a line that is 75 pixels long, then turn to face northeast, and draw a line that is 150 pixels long. We have added a compass to the picture to indicate the directions north, south, west, and east. Northeast is between north and east. Southeast is between south and east. <br /><br /><p>Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order. Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order.</p>
