   :answer_a: json.loads(d)
   :answer_b: json.dumps(d)
   :answer_c: d.json()
   :feedback_a: loads turns a json-formatted string into a list or dictionary
   :feedback_b: dumps turns a list or dictionary into a json-formatted string
   :feedback_c: .json() tries to invoke the json method, but that method is not defined for dictionaries
   :correct: b
