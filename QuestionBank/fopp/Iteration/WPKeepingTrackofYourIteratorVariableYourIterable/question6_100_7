   :answer_e: error, unable to iterate and initialize the iterator variable
   :feedback_a: Incorrect, think about what the for loop will look at first.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect, that is the type of the iterable, not the iterator variable.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect, there is no tuple in the code.
   :feedback_d: Yes, the first item in t is an integer.
   :feedback_e: Incorrect, the for loop is iterating over an iterable object.

   Whatâ€™s the type of your iterator variable in the first iteration?
   
   .. sourcecode:: python
   
       t = [9, "setter", 3, "wing spiker", 10, "middle blocker"]
       for z in t:
           print(z)
