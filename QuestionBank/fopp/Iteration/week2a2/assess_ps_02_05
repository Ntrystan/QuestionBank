    Write code to count the number of characters in ``original_str`` using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable ``num_chars``. Do NOT use the ``len`` function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on this problem, comment it out afterward!)

    original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."
