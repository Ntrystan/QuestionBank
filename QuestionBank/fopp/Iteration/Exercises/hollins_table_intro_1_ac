   A 2-dimensional table of numbers (also called a matrix) can be 
   realized in Python with a list of lists. In the code segment below,
   a table with 3 rows and 4 columns has been defined, with the 
   assignment statement split over three lines for readability.
   Run the code to see what the table looks like when printed.

   table = [[1, 2, 3, 4],
            [5, 6, 7, 8],
            [9, 10, 11, 12]]

   print(table)
