   :feedback_a: i will start with a value of 0 and then j will iterate from 0 to 1. Next, i will be 1 and j will iterate from 0 to 1.  Finally, i will be 2 and j will iterate from 0 to 1.
   :feedback_b: The inner for-loop controls the second digit (j). The inner for-loop must complete before the outer for-loop advances.
   :feedback_c: The inner for-loop controls the second digit (j). Notice that the inner for-loop is over the list [0, 1].
   :feedback_d: The outer for-loop runs 3 times (0, 1, 2) and the inner for-loop runs twice for each time the outer for-loop runs, so this code prints exactly 6 lines.

   What will the following nested for-loop print? (Note, if you are having trouble with this question, review CodeLens 3).
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
      for i in range(3):
          for j in range(2):
              print(i, j)
