   Please order the code fragments in the order in which the Python interpreter would evaluate them. x is 2 and y is 3. Now the interpreter is executing `square(x + sub(square(y), 2 *x))`.
   
   -----
   look up the variable square to get the function object
   =====
   look up the variable x to get 2
   =====
   look up the variable sub to get the function object
   =====
   look up the variable square, again, to get the function object
   =====
   look up the variable y to get 3
   =====
   run the square function on input 3, returning the value 9
   =====
   look up the variable x, again, to get 2
   =====
   multiply 2 * 2 to get 4
   =====
   run the sub function, passing inputs 9 and 4, returning the value 5
   =====
   add 2 and 5 to get 7
   =====
   run the square function, again, on input 7, returning the value 49
