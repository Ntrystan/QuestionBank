    Write code to assign the number of *characters* in the string ``rv`` to a variable ``num_chars``.

    rv = """Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
        'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door;
        Only this and nothing more."""
