    There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called ``square``. It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called ``xyz`` the value ``5*5`` (five squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with ``*``.
    ~~~~
    xyz = ""
