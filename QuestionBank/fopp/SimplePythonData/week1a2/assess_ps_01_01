    There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called ``square``. It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called ``xyz`` the value ``5*5`` (five squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with ``*``.
    ~~~~
    xyz = ""

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
            self.assertEqual(type(xyz), type(3), "Checking type of xyz")
            self.assertEqual(xyz, 25, "Checking if xyz is 25")
            self.assertIn('square', self.getEditorText(), "Testing that 'square' is in your code. (Don't worry about Actual and Expected Values.)")
