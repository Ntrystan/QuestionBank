   :answer_a: Print out the value and determine the data type based on the value printed.
   :answer_b: Use the type function.
   :answer_c: Use it in a known equation and print the result.
   :answer_d: Look at the declaration of the variable.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: You may be able to determine the data type based on the printed value, but it may also be  deceptive, like when a string prints, there are no quotes around it.
   :feedback_b: The type function will tell you the class the value belongs to.
   :feedback_c: Only numeric values can be used in equations.
   :feedback_d: In Python variables are not declared. Values, not variables, have types in Python. A variable can even take on values with different types during a program's execution.
