    :match_1: a = a + 1 ||| 4
    :match_2: a = a||| 3
    :match_3: a -= 2||| 1
    :match_4: b = a + 1||| 3
    :match_5: a = square(a)||| 9
    :match_6: b = square(a)||| 3

    Assume that variable a is initialized to 3 with this line of code: a = 3. Match each piece of code on the left, to the right final value of a on the right if you execute each of the expressions on the left independently.
