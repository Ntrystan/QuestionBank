   Write a program that will convert hours to seconds. This program will also need to get input from a user to see how many hours should be converted and the result should be printed to the user.
   -----
   user_hours = input("How many hours should be converted?: ")
   =====
   num_hours = int(user_hours)
   =====
   minutes = num_hours * 60
   =====
   seconds = minutes * 60
   =====
   print("Number of seconds: " + str(seconds))
