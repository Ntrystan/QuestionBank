   Write a program that will convert weeks to hours. This program will also need to get input from a user to see how many weeks should be converted and the result should be printed to the user.

   user_weeks = input("How many weeks should be converted?: ")
   =====
   num_weeks = int(user_weeks)
   =====
   days = num_weeks * 7
   =====
   hours = days * 24
