   Create a function ``compare_str`` that accepts a letter and a string. The function should return the locations of letter in the string (in the form of a list) and ratio of the number of times the letter appears compared to the total number of letters(in the form of a float). The values should be returned as a tuple. For example ``compare_str('a','Is your mama a llama? I asked my friend Fred. No, is what Fred said.')`` should return ``([9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 24, 55, 64],0.117)``.

   #your code here
   loc,ratio = compare_str("a","Is your mama a llama? I asked my friend Fred. No, is what Fred said.")
   print (loc, ratio)
