   :answer_a: You can't use different variable names on the left and right side of an assignment statement.
   :answer_b: At the end, x still has it's original value instead of y's original value.
   :answer_c: Actually, it works just fine!
   :feedback_a: Sure you can; you can use any variable on the right-hand side that already has a value.
   :feedback_b: Once you assign x's value to y, y's original value is gone.
   :feedback_c: Once you assign x's value to y, y's original value is gone.

        y = x
        x = y
