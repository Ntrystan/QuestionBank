   Create an empty list called ``resps``. Using the list ``percent_rain``, for each percent, if it is above 90, add the string 'Bring an umbrella.' to ``resps``, otherwise if it is above 80, add the string 'Good for the flowers?' to ``resps``, otherwise if it is above 50, add the string 'Watch out for clouds!' to ``resps``, otherwise, add the string 'Nice day!' to ``resps``. Note: if you're sure you've got the problem right but it doesn't pass, then check that you've matched up the strings exactly.

   percent_rain = [94.3, 45, 100, 78, 16, 5.3, 79, 86]
