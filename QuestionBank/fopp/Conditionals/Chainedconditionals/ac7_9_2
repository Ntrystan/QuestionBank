   Create one conditional to find whether "false" is in string ``str1``. If so, assign variable ``output`` the string "False. You aren't you?". Check to see if "true" is in string ``str1`` and if it is then assign "True! You are you!" to the variable ``output``. If neither are in ``str1``, assign "Neither true nor false!" to ``output``.
   ~~~~
   str1 = "Today you are you! That is truer than true! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!"
