   Create a variable, ``b``, and assign it the value of ``15``. Then, write code to see if the value ``b`` is greater than that of ``a``. If it is, ``a``'s value should be multiplied by 2. If the value of ``b`` is less than or equal to ``a``, nothing should happen. Finally, create variable ``c`` and assign it the value of the sum of ``a`` and ``b``.
