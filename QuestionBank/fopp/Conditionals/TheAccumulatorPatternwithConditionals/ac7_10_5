   For each string in the list ``words``, find the number of characters in the string. If the number of characters in the string is greater than 3, add 1 to the variable ``num_words`` so that ``num_words`` should end up with the total number of words with more than 3 characters.

   words = ["water", "chair", "pen", "basket", "hi", "car"]
