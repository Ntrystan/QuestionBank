   Write code so that if ``"STATS 250"`` is in the list ``schedule``, then the string ``"You could be in Information Science!"`` is assigned to the variable ``resp``. Otherwise, the string ``"That's too bad."`` should be assigned to the variable ``resp``.

   schedule = ["SI 106", "STATS 250", "SI 110", "ENGLISH 124/125"]
