    Write code that counts the number of words in ``sentence`` that contain *either* an "a" or an "e". Store the result in the variable ``num_a_or_e``.
    
    Note 1: be sure to not double-count words that contain both an a and an e.
    
    HINT 1: Use the ``in`` operator.
    
    HINT 2: You can either use ``or`` or ``elif``.
    
    
    Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.
