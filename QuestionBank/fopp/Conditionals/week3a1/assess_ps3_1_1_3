    Write code to count the number of strings in list ``items`` that have the character ``w`` in it. Assign that number to the variable ``acc_num``.
    
    HINT 1: Use the accumulation pattern!
    
    HINT 2: the ``in`` operator checks whether a substring is present in a string.
    
    
    Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.
    ~~~~
    items = ["whirring", "wow!", "calendar", "wry", "glass", "", "llama","tumultuous","owing"]
