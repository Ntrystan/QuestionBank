    Prior to 2019, WVU only allowed students to D/F repeat a course if they had attempted less than 60 credit hours. Starting in 2019, WVU allows students to D/F repeat courses no matter how many credit hours they have attempted.

    Write code that uses the **current_year** and **credit_hours_completed** variables to determine if the student is eligible to D/F repeat. Store the result as a *True* or *False* value in a variable named **repeat_eligible**.
