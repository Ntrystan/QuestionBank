    Give the **logical opposites** of these conditions, meaning an expression that would
    produce False whenever this expression produces True, and vice versa.  You are not
    allowed to use the ``not`` operator.

    #.  ``a > b``
    #.  ``a >= b``
    #.  ``a >= 18  and  day == 3``
    #.  ``a >= 18  or  day != 3``
