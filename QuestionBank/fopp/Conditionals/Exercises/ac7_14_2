    A year is a **leap year** if it is divisible by 4; however, if the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless the year is **also** evenly divisible by 400 then it is a leap year. Write code that asks the user to input a year and output True if it's a leap year, or False otherwise. Use if statements.

    .. table::

       =======  =====
       Year     Leap?
       =======  =====
       1944     True
       2011     False
       1986     False
       1800     False
       1900     False
       2000     True
       2056     True
       =======  =====

    Above are some examples of what the output should be for various inputs.
