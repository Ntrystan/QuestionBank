    In the problem below, you are given a list of integers named ``num_list``.
    Write Python code that calculates the numeric average of the `positive`
    items in ``num_list`` and stores it in a variable named ``pos_avg``.  

    Also calculate the numeric average of the `negative` items in ``num_list``
    and store that result in a variable named ``neg_avg``.

    Finally, print the results to the screen.  I have included a comment that
    shows you how the results should appear.  Make certain your program
    is general, `i.e.` that it will work for any values in ``num_list``.  Do not hard
    code any results.
    ~~~~
    num_list = [-21, -13, 21, 12, -19, -19, 21, -3, -6, 13]

   
    # Your final output should look 
    # like the two lines below

    # Avg of pos = 16.75
    # Avg of neg = -13.5
