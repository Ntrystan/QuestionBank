   Ask users to input the width and length of a building in feet. Store the values in the **width** and **height** variables, respectively.
   Use conditional statements to determine which dimension is longer or if they are the same. Store the strings *width*, *height*, or *same* in the **longer_dimension** variable as appropriate.
