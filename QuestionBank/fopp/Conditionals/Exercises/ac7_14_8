    Given the lengths of three sides of a triange, determine whether the triangle is right angled. If it is, the assign ``True`` to the variable ``is_rightangled``. If it's not, then assign ``False`` to the variable ``is_rightangled``.
    
    Hint: floating point arithmetic is not always exactly accurate,
    so it is not safe to test floating point numbers for equality.
    If a good programmer wants to know whether
    ``x`` is equal or close enough to ``y``, they would probably code it up as
    
    .. sourcecode:: python
    
        if  abs(x - y) < 0.001:      # if x is approximately equal to y
            ...
