   The following code is supposed to replace the first names in the list ``first_names`` with the more formal names in the list ``formal_names``

   For instance, ``formalizer("Scott talked to Janet about Coelina.")`` should return ``Dr. Hill talked to Dr. Salzwedel about Ms. Byers.``

   There are four errors with this code: fix those errors so the code runs properly. Hint: you do not need to delete any of the code that is given; you only need to add to it.

   def formalizer(sent):
       first_names=["Scott","Janet","Coelina","Greg"]
       formal_names=["Dr. Hill","Dr. Salzwedel","Ms. Byers", "Dr. Thompson"]
       for i in range(len(first_names))
           sentence.replace(first_names[i],formal_names[i])
   print(formalizer("Scott talked to Janet about Coelina."))
