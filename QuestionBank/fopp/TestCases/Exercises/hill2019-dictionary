   Write a function called ``wordfreq`` which takes in a sentence (as a string without punctuation) and returns a dictionary whose keys are lower-case words and whose values are the number of times that word appears.
   
   For example, ``wordfreq("Her can of fish can feed her")`` should return ``{"her":2,"can":2,"of":1,"fish":1,"feed":1}``
   (The order might vary.)

   print(wordfreq("Her can of fish can feed her"))
