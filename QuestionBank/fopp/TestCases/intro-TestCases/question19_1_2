   :feedback_a: You might not notice the error, if the code just produces a wrong output rather generating an error. And it may be difficult to figure out the original cause of an error when you do get one.
   :feedback_b: Test cases let you test some pieces of code as you write them, rather than waiting for problems to show themselves later.

   message when the program runs incorrectly, and that's all you need for debugging.
