   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: No matter how many tests you write, there may be some input that you didn't test, and the function could do the wrong thing on that input.
   :feedback_b: The tests should cover as many edge cases as you can think of, but there's always a possibility that the function does badly on some input that you didn't include as a test case.
