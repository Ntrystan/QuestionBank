    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: blanked only takes two inputs; this provides three inputs to the blanked function
    :feedback_b: The second argument to the blanked function should be the letters that have been guessed, not the blanked version of the word
    :feedback_c: This checks whether the value returned from the blanked function is 'u_d__'.

    For the hangman game, the blanked function takes a word and some letters that have been guessed, and returns a version of the word with _ for all the letters that haven't been guessed. Which of the following is the correct way to write a test to check that 'under' will be blanked as ``'u_d__'`` when the user has guessed letters d and u so far?
