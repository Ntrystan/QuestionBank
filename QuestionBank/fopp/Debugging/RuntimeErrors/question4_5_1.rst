   :answer_a: Attempting to divide by 0.
   :answer_b: Forgetting a colon at the end of a statement where one is required.
   :answer_c: Forgetting to divide by 100 when printing a percentage amount.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Python cannot reliably tell if you are trying to divide by 0 until it is executing your program (e.g., you might be asking the user for a value and then dividing by that valueâ€”you cannot know what value the user will enter before you run the program).
   :feedback_b: This is a problem with the formal structure of the program.  Python knows where colons are required and can detect when one is missing simply by looking at the code without running it.
   :feedback_c: This will produce the wrong answer, but Python will not consider it an error at all.  The programmer is the one who understands that the answer produced is wrong.
