   Suppose you are working on a recipe website.  Recipes have a title, a list of ingredients, and an instructions section.  Make a webpage that shows the recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches with bacon and tomato.   The ingredients should be displayed as an unordered list, with no bullets.  meat ingredients should have a light red background color, vegetables should have a light green background, and dairy products should have a light yellow.  The title should be in a sans serif font of your choice, and the instructions should have a heading "Instructions" and the font for the instructions should be italic.
