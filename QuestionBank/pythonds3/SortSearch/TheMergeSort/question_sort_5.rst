   :feedback_a: This is the second half of the list.
   :feedback_b: Yes, mergesort will continue to recursively move toward the beginning of the list until it hits a base case.
   :feedback_c: Remember mergesort doesn't work on the right half of the list until the left half is completely sorted.
   :feedback_d: This is the list after 4 recursive calls
