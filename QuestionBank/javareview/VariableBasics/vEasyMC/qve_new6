   :answer_a: a random number from 0 to 4
   :answer_b: a random number from 1 to 5
   :answer_c: a random number from 5 to 9
   :answer_d: a random number from 5 to 10
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was (int) (Math.random * 5)
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was ((int) (Math.random * 5)) + 1
   :feedback_c: Math.random returns a value from 0 to not quite 1.  When you multiply it by 5 you get a value from 0 to not quite 5.  When you cast to int you get a value from 0 to 4.  Adding 5 gives a value from 5 to 9.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if Math.random returned a value between 0 and 1, but it won't ever return 1.  The cast to int results in a number from 0 to 4.  Adding 5 gives a value from 5 to 9.

   Given the following code segment, what is the value of ``num`` when it finishes executing?

    .. code-block:: java

      double value = Math.random();
      int num = (int) (value * 5) + 5;
