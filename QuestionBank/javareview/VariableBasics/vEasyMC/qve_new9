   :answer_d: 0.3 with an infinite number of 3's following the decimal point
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was (1 / 3).
   :feedback_b: It will give you more than just one digit after the decimal sign.
   :feedback_c: The computer can not represent an infinite number of 3's after the decimal point so it only keeps 14 to 15 significant digits.
   :feedback_d: The computer can not represent an infinite number of 3's after the decimal point.

   What will the following code print?

    .. code-block:: java

      System.out.println(1.0 / 3);
