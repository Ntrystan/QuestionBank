   :answer_a: Math.random() < 0.4
   :answer_b: Math.random() > 0.4
   :answer_c: Math.random() == 0.4
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This is about 40% of the range from 0 to not quite 1 (which is what the Math.random method returns).
   :feedback_b: This will be about a 60% chance.
   :feedback_c: Do not use == with double values!  Remember that Math.random can return any number between 0 and not quite 1 (about .99999999).

   Which of the following is a correct test for a 40% possibility?
