   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: While count starts at 0 it is incremented when a match is found, which will happen when i1 is 1 and i2 is 0.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the loop stopped after the first match was found, but it does not.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the code only looked for a match at the same indicies.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if both i2 and i1 were incremented when a match was found.
   :feedback_e: This code only increments i2 when a match is found, which means that the 2 at position 2 in x1 matches both 2's in x2.

   What is the value of ``count`` after the following code has executed?

   .. code-block:: java

     int[ ] x1 = {0, 1, 2, 3};
     int[ ] x2 = {1, 2, 2, 3};
     int i1 = 0;
     int i2 = 0;
     int count = 0;
     while ( (i1 < x1.length) &&
             (i2 < x2.length))
     {
        if (x1[i1] == x2[i2])
        {
           count++;
           i2++;
        }
        else if (x1[i1] < x2[i2])
        {
           i1++;
        }
        else
        { // x1[i1] > x2[i2]
           i2++;
        }
     }
