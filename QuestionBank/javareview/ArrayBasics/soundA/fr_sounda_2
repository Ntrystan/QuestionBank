   :answer_a: samples[i].set(-limit);
   :answer_b: samples[i] = limit;
   :answer_c: samples[i] = -limit;
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: There is no set method on arrays.
   :feedback_b: This would set the value at index i to limit rather than the negative of the limit.
   :feedback_c: This will set the value at index i to the negative of the limit.

   Which is the correct code for changing the current value to the negative of the limit?
