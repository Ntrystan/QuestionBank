   :answer_c: method2 only
   :answer_d: method2 and method3
   :answer_e: all of them
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The problem with method2 is that if num1==num2 the first if will execute, but so will the second if and result will be set to 1.
   :feedback_b: Another will work as well.
   :feedback_c: This one won't work.  The problem with method2 is that if num1==num2 the first if will execute, but so will the second if and result will be set to 1.
   :feedback_d: While method3 will work, method2 won't.  The problem with method2 is that if num1==num2 the first if will execute, but so will the second if and result will be set to 1.
   :feedback_e: Two will work, but one will not.

   Consider the following methods. Which of method1, method2, and method3 would give the same result as sample?

   .. code-block:: java

      public void sample(int num1, int num2) {
         int result = 99;
         if (num1==num2) {result = 0;}
         else if (num1>num2){result = 1;}
         else {result = -1;}
         System.out.println(result);
      }

      public void method1(int num1, int num2) {
         int result=99;
             if (num1 == num2) {result = 0;}
             else {
                if(num1 > num2) {result = 1;}
                else {result = -1;}
             }
        System.out.println(result);
      }

      public void method2(int num1, int num2) {
             int result = 99;
             if (num1 == num2) {result = 0;}
             if (num1 >= num2) {result = 1;}
             else {result = -1;}
         System.out.println(result);
      }

      public void method3(int num1, int num2) {
             int result = 99 ;
             if (num1 == num2) {result = 0;}
             if (num1 > num2) {result = 1;}
             if (num1 < num2) {result = -1;}
             System.out.println(result);
      }
