   :feedback_a: numStudents is brief, but still tells the user what the variable represents. Num is a common shortening of number and is allowed.
   :feedback_b: While this name gives the user information about what the variable represents, it is too long and therefore should be shorter.
   :feedback_c: Number is commonly abbreviated as num and should be abbreviated here.
   :feedback_d: Num is a satisfactory abbreviation of number, but stud is not a common enough abbreviation for student.
   :feedback_e: Variable names can start with '_', '$', or a letter, but not '#'.

   Which of the following is a good name for an integer variable that represents the number of students in a class?
