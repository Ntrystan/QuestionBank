   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The second loop executes 5 times for each of the 5 times the first loop executes, so the answer should be 5 * 5.
   :feedback_b: The second loop executes 5 times for each of the 5 times the first loop executes, so the answer should be 5 * 5.
   :feedback_c: The first loop will execute 5 times, and for each time through, the second loop will execute 5 times. So the answer is the number of times through the first loop times the number of times through the second.
   :feedback_d: The second loop executes 5 times for each of the 5 times the first loop executes, so the answer should be 5 * 5.
   :feedback_e: The second loop executes 5 times for each of the 5 times the first loop executes, so the answer should be 5 * 5.

   How many stars are output when the following code is executed?

   .. code-block:: java

     for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++)
           System.out.println("*");
     }
