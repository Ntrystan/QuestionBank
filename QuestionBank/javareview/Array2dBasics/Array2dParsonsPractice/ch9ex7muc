   The following program segment is a method that should accept a two-dimensional int array and return a single dimensional (normal) int array containing the average of each of the columns.  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>three extra blocks</b> that are not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
