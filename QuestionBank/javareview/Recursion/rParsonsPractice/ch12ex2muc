   The following method should multiply the two passed-in positive integers (using the fact that multiplcation is repeated addition) -- so multipy(3, 4) should become 12 (3+3+3+3).  But the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.
