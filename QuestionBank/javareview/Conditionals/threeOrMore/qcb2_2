   :answer_a: x is negative
   :answer_b: x is zero
   :answer_c: x is positive
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This will only print if x has been set to a number less than zero. Has it?
   :feedback_b: This will only print if x has been set to 0.  Has it?
   :feedback_c: The first condition is false and x is not equal to zero so the else will execute.

   What does the following code print when x has been set to 2000?

   .. code-block:: java

     if (x < 0) System.out.println("x is negative");
     else if (x == 0) System.out.println("x is zero");
     else System.out.println("x is positive");
