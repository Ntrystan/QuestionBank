   :answer_a: s1 == s2 && s1 == s3
   :answer_b: s2.equals(s3) && s1.equals(s3)
   :answer_c: s1 != s2 && s1 == s3
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Do s1 and s2 refer to the same object?
   :feedback_b: Does s2 have the same characters as s1 or s3?
   :feedback_c: Because you used the same string literal s1 and s3 will refer to the same object.  Since s1 and s2 refer to different string literals they do not refer to the same object.

   Which of the following is true after the code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = "hi";
     String s2 = "bye";
     String s3 = "hi";
