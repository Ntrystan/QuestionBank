   :answer_a: O(1)
   :answer_b: O(n<sup>3</sup>)
   :answer_c: O(n)
   :answer_d: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: O(1) would mean that the algorithm runs in constant time. This isn't true because there are several comparisons happening in the algorithm.
   :feedback_b: O(n<sup>3</sup>) suggests that there are three consecutively nested loops. If you look at the example algorithm, it is obvious that there are not three nested loops.
   :feedback_c: O(n) is linear time. The time it takes for this program to run doesn't grow linearly.
   :feedback_d: Correct. Since you are not only comparing the weight of a branch but also if the branch has already been connected to, this would make the Big-O of the algorithm O(n<sup>2</sup>)

    spanning tree algorithm?
