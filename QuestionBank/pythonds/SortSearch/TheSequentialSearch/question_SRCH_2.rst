   :feedback_a: You do not need to search the entire list, since it is ordered you can stop searching when you have compared with a value larger than the key.
   :feedback_b: Since 11 is less than the key value 13 you need to keep searching.
   :feedback_c: Since 14 is greater than the key value 13 you can stop.
   :feedback_d: Because 12 is less than the key value 13 you need to keep going.
