   :feedback_a: Five comparisons would get the second 18 in the list.
   :feedback_b: You do not need to search the entire list, only until you find the key you are looking for.
   :feedback_c: No, remember in a sequential search you start at the beginning and check each key until you find what you are looking for or exhaust the list.
   :feedback_d: In this case only 2 comparisons were needed to find the key.
