    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Shell sort is about ``n^1.5``
    :feedback_b: Quick sort can be O(n log n), but if the pivot points are not well chosen and the list is just so, it can be O(n^2).
    :feedback_c: Merge Sort is the only guaranteed O(n log n) even in the worst case.  The cost is that merge sort uses more memory.
    :feedback_d: Insertion sort is ``O(n^2)``
