   :feedback_a: Remember the first thing added to the queue is the first thing removed.  FIFO
   :feedback_b: Yes, first in first out means that hello is gone
   :feedback_c: Queues, and Stacks are both data structures where you can only access the first and the last thing.
   :feedback_d: Ooops, maybe you missed the dequeue call at the end?

   Suppose you have the following series of queue operations.
   
   ::
   
       q = Queue()
       q.enqueue('hello')
       q.enqueue('dog')
       q.enqueue(3)
       q.dequeue()
   
   What items are left on the queue?
