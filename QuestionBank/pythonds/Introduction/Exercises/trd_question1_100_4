   Construct a block of code that correctly implements the recursive function for calcuating the factorial.
   -----
   f factorial(n):
   rint("factorial has been called with n = " + str(n))
   f n == 1:
   return 1
   lse:
   res = n * factorial(n-1)
   print("intermediate result for ", n, " * factorial(" ,n-1, "): ",res)
   return res	
   
   int(factorial(5))
