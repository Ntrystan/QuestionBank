   Write a function called ``mySqrt`` that will approximate the square root of a number, call it n, by using
   Newton's algorithm.
   Newton's approach is an iterative guessing algorithm where the initial guess is n/2 and each subsequent guess
   is computed using   the formula:  newguess = (1/2) * (oldguess + (n/oldguess)).
