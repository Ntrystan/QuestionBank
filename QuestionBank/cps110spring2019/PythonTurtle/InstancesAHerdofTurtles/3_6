   The following program has one turtle, "jamal", draw a capital L in blue and then another, "tina", draw a line to the west in orange as shown to the left, <img src="../_static/TwoTurtles1.png" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" />.  The program should do all set-up, have "jamal" draw the L, and then have "tina" draw the line.   Finally, it should set the window to close when the user clicks in it.<br /><br /><p>Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.  Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order.</p>
