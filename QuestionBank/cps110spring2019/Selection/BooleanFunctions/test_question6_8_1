   :feedback_a: A Boolean function is just like any other function, but it always returns True or False.
   :feedback_b: A Boolean function may take any number of arguments (including 0, though that is rare), of any type.
   :feedback_c: A Boolean expression is a statement that evaluates to True or False, e.g. 5+3==8.  A function is a series of expressions grouped together with a name that are only executed when you call the function.
