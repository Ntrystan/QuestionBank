   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: You cannot concatenate a list with an integer.
   :feedback_b: Yes, in order to perform concatenation you would need to write alist+[999].  You must have two lists.

   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [4, 2, 8, 6, 5]
     alist = alist + 999
     print(alist)
