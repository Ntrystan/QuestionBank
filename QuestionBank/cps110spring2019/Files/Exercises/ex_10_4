   Here is a file called ``labdata.txt`` that contains some sample data from a lab experiment.

   Interpret the data file ``labdata.txt`` such that each line contains a an x,y coordinate pair.
   Write a function called ``plotRegression`` that reads the data from this file
   and uses a turtle to plot those points and a best fit line according to the following
   formulas:

   :math:`y = \bar{y} + m(x - \bar{x})`

   :math:`m = \frac{\sum{x_iy_i - n\bar{x}\bar{y}}}{\sum{x_i^2}-n\bar{x}^2}`

   where :math:`\bar{x}` is the mean of the x-values, :math:`\bar{y}` is the mean of the y-
   values and :math:`n` is the number of points.  If you are not familiar with the
   mathematical :math:`\sum` it is the sum operation.  For example :math:`\sum{x_i}`
   means to add up all the x values.

   Your program should analyze the points and correctly scale the window using
   ``setworldcoordinates`` so that that each point can be plotted.  Then you should
   draw the best fit line, in a different color, through the points.
