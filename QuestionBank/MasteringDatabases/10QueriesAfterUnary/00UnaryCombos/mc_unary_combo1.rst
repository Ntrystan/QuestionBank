   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: When you first look at this, it is understandable that you would think to start with Skill. However, look more closely at not only the nouns in this query, but the active verb, which is achieved in this case.
   :feedback_b: A first glance might make you guess Creature, but try to look more closely at not only the nouns in this query, but the active verb, which is achieved in this case.
   :feedback_c: A first glance might make you guess Town, but try to look more closely at not only the nouns in this query, but the active verb, which is achieved in this case.
   :feedback_d: Good! You are starting to look at both verbs (achieved) and nouns to consider what the input relation might be.

   Which relation will be the input relation for these two above queries?
