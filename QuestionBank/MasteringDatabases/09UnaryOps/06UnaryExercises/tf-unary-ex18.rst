   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: False
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes- the point is that the whole name is the base and will be underlined because the result relation contains one column with one row.
   :feedback_b: Review the examples of group over nothing in section 9.7 and notice how we underlined the whole name of the result.

   The base of the result relation is the same as the answer for the previous question.
