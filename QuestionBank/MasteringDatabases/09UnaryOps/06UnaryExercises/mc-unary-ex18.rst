   :answer_a: count of Creatures
   :answer_b: Creature
   :answer_c: creatureCount of Creature
   :answer_d: creatureCountOfCreature
   :correct: a,c,d
   :feedback_a: 'count of Creatures' is pithy and reasonably correct way of expressing the result relation, though C and D are nice because it provides a column name that you can use for further analysis, which often happens.
   :feedback_b: The result relation from a group is never the same as the input relation.
   :feedback_c: Giving a name of creatureCount to the single resulting column is helpful for future use of that result relation as an input relation.
   :feedback_d: Some analysts prefer one single long name, since this is returning a single-column relation.

   Which of these is a reasonable name for H (there is more than one correct answer)?
