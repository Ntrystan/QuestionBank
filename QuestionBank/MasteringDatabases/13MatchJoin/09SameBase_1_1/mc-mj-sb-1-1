   :feedback_a: The same-base, symmetric-either 1-1 case means the base of the result relations stays the same as the two same input relation bases. What is the base, which implies its identifier?
   :feedback_b: The same-base, symmetric-either 1-1 case means the base of the result relations stays the same as the two same input relation bases. What is the base, which implies its identifier?
   :feedback_c: Correct! The same-base, symmetric-either 1-1 case means the base of the result relations stays the same as the two same input relation bases.

   Which of these is the identifier for the result relation?
