   :answer_a: Vectors can change size.
   :answer_b: Vectors offer all of the features and protections of Python lists
   :answer_c: Vectors don't use contiguous memory, so elements can be inserted.
   :answer_d: more than one of the above
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Right! Good job!
   :feedback_b: Not all of the protections of lists are offered by vectors; one can still iterate off of either end.
   :feedback_c: No. Although elements can be inserted in vectors, they do require contiguous memory.
   :feedback_d: No. Only one of the above is correct.
   :feedback_e: One of the above is indeed correct.
