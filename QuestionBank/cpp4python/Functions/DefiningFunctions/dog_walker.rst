    :feedback_a: Correct, nothing is returned!
    :feedback_b: Not quite, check the value preceding the name of the function!
    :feedback_c: Not quite, dog is not even a data type!
    :feedback_d: Not quite, that is the name of the function itself!

    What is the correct return type of the function above **int main()**?
