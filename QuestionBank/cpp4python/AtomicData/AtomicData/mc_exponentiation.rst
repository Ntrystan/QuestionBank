  :answer_a: ``4**5``
  :answer_b: ``5**4``
  :answer_c: ``4^5``
  :answer_d: ``pow(4, 5)``
  :correct: d
  :feedback_a: No, ``**`` is used in Python, not C++.
  :feedback_b: No, ``**`` is used in Python, not C++, and the operators are reversed.
  :feedback_c: No. The ``^`` is a valid operator in C++, but it does something else.
  :feedback_d: You got it! Remember the cmath library will need to be included for pow() to work.

  How do I raise 4 to 5th power in C++?
