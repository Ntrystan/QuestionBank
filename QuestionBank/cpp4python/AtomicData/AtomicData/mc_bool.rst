   :answer_a: Setting theBool to anything other than true or false is ignored.
   :answer_b: Setting theBool to anything > 0 will be true and false otherwise.
   :answer_c: false == 0 and true = !false i.e. anything that is not zero and can be converted to a Boolean is not false, thus it must be true.
   :answer_d: None of the above.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: No. Try changing the code and setting theBool to 0.
   :feedback_b: No. Try changing the code and setting theBool to -4.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: Try again. One of the above is correct. You might try changing the code and rerunning.

   Why did theBool output a value of 1 after being set to 4?
