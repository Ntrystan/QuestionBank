   :answer_a: Yes, ofstream is required to edit the file.
   :answer_b: Yes, using ifstream will wipe the file clean without using ofstream first.

   :answer_d: No, ofstream is exclusively used for reading files.

   :feedback_a: Wrong! Even though it is required for editing files, using ofstream first will cause problems when it opens a file that has previous work saved on it.
   :feedback_b: Wrong! ifstream is only used to read files, therefore it will never edit the contents of one.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: Wrong! ifstream is used to read files instead.

   Would it be a good idea to first use ``ofstream`` to open the file?
