   :answer_a: import math
   :answer_b: include math
   :answer_c: use math
   :answer_d:  You don't need a statement.  You can always use the math module
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The module must be imported before you can use anything declared inside the module.
   :feedback_b: The correct term is not include, but you are close.
   :feedback_c: You will be using parts of the module, but that is not the right term.
   :feedback_d: You cannot use a Python module without a statement at the top of your program that explicitly tells Python you want to use the module.

   Which statement allows you to use the math module in your program?
