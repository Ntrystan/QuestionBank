   :answer_d: Error, len(s) is 12 and there is no index 12.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Take a look at the index calculation again, len(s)-5.
   :feedback_b: Yes, len(s) is 12 and 12-5 is 7.  Use 7 as index and remember to start counting with 0.
   :feedback_c: s is at index 11
   :feedback_d: You subtract 5 before using the index operator so it will work.


   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

      s = "python rocks"
      print(s[len(s)-5])
