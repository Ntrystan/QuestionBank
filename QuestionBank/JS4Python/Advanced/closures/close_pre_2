    What values dos the call to inner1 print out?

    .. code-block:: javascript

        var z = 2;
        function container() {
            let x = 3

            function inner1() {
                console.log(x, y, z)
            }

            let y = 4
            z = 9

            function inner2() {
                z = x + y
                console.log(x,y,z)
            }

            return {inner1, inner2}
        }

        let { inner1, inner2 } = container()
        inner2()
        inner1()

    - 3 4 2

      - No, the closure captures a reference to z, so when inner2 is called it reassigns z the value of 7

    - 3 4 7

      + Correct!

    - 3 4 9

      - No, close but since inner2 is called first it reassigns z the value of 7

    - An error occurs

      - This is all legal!
