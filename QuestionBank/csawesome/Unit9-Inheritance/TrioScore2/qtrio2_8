   :answer_a: Yes
   :answer_b: No
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: What if b is equal to c but both are greater than a?
   :feedback_b: This does not always compute the price correctly (when b is equal to c and they are both greater than a, it should return b+c, not a+b).

   Should the student earn 1 point for correctly calculating the price and making it available to be returned from ``getPrice``?
