   :answer_e: 10
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if the variable col was 0 because then it would add 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 which is 4.
   :feedback_b: Since col is matrix[0].length - 2 it is 4 - 2 which is 2.  This code will loop through all the rows and add all the numbers in the third column (index is 2) which is 2  + 2 + 3 + 1 which is 8.
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if the variable col was 1 because then it would add 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 which is 9.
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if the variable col was 3 becuase then it would add 2 + 4 + 4+ 2 which is 12.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if we were adding the values in the 3rd row (row = 2) instead of the 3rd column.  This would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10.

   Given the following code segment, what is the value of sum after this code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

      int[][] matrix = { {1,1,2,2},{1,2,2,4},{1,2,3,4},{1,4,1,2}};

      int sum = 0;
      int col = matrix[0].length - 2;
      for (int row = 0; row < 4; row++)
      {
         sum = sum + matrix[row][col];
      }
