   :answer_a: single for each loop
   :answer_b: nested for loop
   :answer_c: nested while loop
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This is a two-dimensional array so you would need a nested for-each loop.
   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: You could use a nested while loop, but since you know the numbers of rows and columns a nested for loop is usually better since with a while loop you could forget to increment the row or column index.
