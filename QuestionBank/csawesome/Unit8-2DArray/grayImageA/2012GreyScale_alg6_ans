 :answer_b: (int pv : row)
 :answer_c: (int pv[] : row)
 :answer_d: (int col : pixelValues)
 :correct: b
 :feedback_a: This is not the correct way to initialize a for each loop
 :feedback_b: Correct!
 :feedback_c: For the inner bound, you are no longer iterating through an array so you do not need to include the '[]'
 :feedback_d: Your outer bound is already iterating through pixelValues, your inner bound needs to loop through something else

 What could you write for the inner for loop so that it iterates through the columns of the array?
