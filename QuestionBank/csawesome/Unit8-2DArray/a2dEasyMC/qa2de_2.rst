   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: The code <code>letterGrid[0][2] = "S";</code> actually sets the 1st row and 3rd column to hold a reference to the <code>String</code> object "S".
   :feedback_b: This would be true if row and column indicies started at 1 instead of 0 and if this was in column major order.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if row and column indicies started at 1 instead of 0.
   :feedback_d: In row-major order the row is specified first followed by the column.  Row and column indicies start with 0.  So <code>letterGrid[2][0]</code> is the 3rd row and 1st column.
   :feedback_e: This would set the element at the first row and column.
