     :feedback_a: Since 1/1/19 is a Tuesday (2), Jan. 8th 2019, the 8th day of the year, is 7 days later, but since there are only 7 days of the week, so we need to start over at 0 on each Sunday.
     :feedback_b: Since 1/1/19 is a Tuesday, Jan. 8th 2019 is 7 days later so would fall on the same day of the week.
     :feedback_c: Since 1/1/19 is a Tuesday, Jan. 8th 2019 is 7 days later.
     :feedback_d: Since 1/1/19 is a Tuesday (2), Jan. 8th 2019, the 8th day of the year, is 7 days later, but since there are only 7 days of the week, so we need to start over at 0 on each Sunday.
