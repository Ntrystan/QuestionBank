   :feedback_a: The second loop executes 5 times for each of the 5 times the first loop executes, so the answer should be 5 * 5.
   :feedback_b: The second loop executes 5 times for each of the 5 times the first loop executes, so the answer should be 5 * 5.
   :feedback_c: The first loop will execute 5 times, and for each time through, the second loop will execute 5 times. So the answer is the number of times through the first loop times the number of times through the second.
   :feedback_d: The second loop executes 5 times for each of the 5 times the first loop executes, so the answer should be 5 * 5.
   :feedback_e: The second loop executes 5 times for each of the 5 times the first loop executes, so the answer should be 5 * 5.
