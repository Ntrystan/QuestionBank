     :answer_a: Loop while the current number is greater than 10.
     :answer_b: Loop while the current number is greater than 9.
     :answer_c: Loop while the current number is greater than 0.
     :correct: c
     :feedback_a: What happens if the number is 10 in this case?
     :feedback_b: Does this actually test the first digit in a number?
     :feedback_c: We will know that we are out of digits when x / 10 is 0. This wouldn't work if the number passed to the method was 0 originally, but were told in the precondition that number is greater than 0 to start.
