   :answer_a: A rectangle of 9 rows and 5 stars per row.
   :answer_b: A rectangle of 6 rows and 6 stars per row.
   :answer_c: A rectangle of 7 rows and 5 stars per row.

   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Did you notice what i was initialized to?
   :feedback_b: It would print 6 rows if it was <code>i < 9</code>.
   :feedback_c: It would print 5 stars per row if it was <code>j > 1</code>.
   :feedback_d: The outer loop executes 9 - 3 + 1 = 7 times and the inner 6 - 1 + 1 = 6 times.
