   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the outer loop executed 8 times and the inner 5 times, but what is the initial value of <code>i</code>?
   :feedback_b: The outer loop executes 7-3+1=5 times and the inner 4-1+1=4 so this will print 5 * 4 = 20 stars.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the outer loop executed 6 times such as if it was <code>i <= 8</code>.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the inner loop executed 5 times such as if it was <code>y <= 5</code>.

   How many times does the following code print a ``*``?

   .. code-block:: java

      for (int i = 3; i < 8; i++)
      {
          for (int y = 1; y < 5; y++)
          {
              System.out.print("*");
          }
          System.out.println();
      }
