   :feedback_a: This would be true if substring returned all the characters from the first index to the last inclusive, but it does not include the character at the last index.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was s1.substring(0,1)
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it was s1.substring(0,2)
   :feedback_d: Substring returns all the characters from the starting index to the last index - 1.

     String s2 = s1.substring(0,3);
