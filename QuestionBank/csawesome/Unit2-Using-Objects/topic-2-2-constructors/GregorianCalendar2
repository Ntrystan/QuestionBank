    import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

    public class Test2
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            GregorianCalendar today = new GregorianCalendar();
            GregorianCalendar myDate = new GregorianCalendar(2020, 0, 1);
            System.out.println("Current date and time on server: "
                         + today.getTime());
            System.out.println("New Year's day: "
                         + myDate.getTime());
        }
     }
