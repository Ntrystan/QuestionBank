   :answer_a: An attribute of the atomicMass object is double.
   :answer_b: An instance of the element1 class is ChemicalElement.
   :answer_c: An attribute of the element1 object is atomicNumber.
   :answer_d: An instance of a ChemicalElement object is elementName.
   :answer_e: An attribute of atomicMass is element1.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: double is a data type, not an attribute.
   :feedback_b: The classname is ChemicalElement and the object instance is element1.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: The classname is ChemicalElement and the object instance is element1.
   :feedback_e: An attribute of element1 is atomicMass.

    A student has created a ChemicalElement class. The class contains variables to represent the following.
    - A double variable called atomicMass to represent the atomic mass of the element.
    - A String variable called elementName to represent the name of the element.
    - An int variable called atomicNumber to indicate whether the atomic number of the element.

    The object element1 will be declared as type ChemicalElement.
    Which of the following statements is accurate?
