    Consider the following methods, which appear in the same class.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public void celsiusToFahrenheit(double cTemp)
        {
            double fTemp = (cTemp * 9)/5 + 32;
            printTemperature(cTemp, fTemp);
        }
    
        public void printTemperature(double celsius, double fahrenheit)
        {
            System.out.print(celsius + "-->" + fahrenheit);
        }
    
    Assume that the method call ``celsiusToFahrenheit(5)`` appears in a method in the same class. What is printed as a result of the method call?
    
    - 5.0 --> 77.0
    
      - (5 * 9)/5 + 32 = 41
    
    - 41 --> 5
    
      - Notice the order of parameters in printTemperature.
    
    - celsius --> fahrenheit
    
      - These are variables and their values would be printed.
    
    - 5 --> 33.8
    
      - (5 * 9)/5 + 32 = 41
    
    - 5.0 --> 41.0
    
      + Correct! (5 * 9)/5 + 32 = 41 and doubles print out with .0 at the end.
