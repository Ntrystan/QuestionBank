    Consider the following class. Which of the following code segments, when placed in a method in a class other than Liquid, will construct a Liquid object l with a boilingPoint of 98.6 ?
   
    .. code-block:: java
   
        public class Liquid
        {
            private double boilingPoint;
            private double freezingPoint;
   
            public Liquid()
            {
                boilingPoint = 0.0;
            }
   
            public Liquid(double b)
            {
                boilingPoint = b;
            }
        }
