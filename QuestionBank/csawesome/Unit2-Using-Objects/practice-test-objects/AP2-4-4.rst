    Consider the following methods, which appear in the same class.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public void calculatePizzaOrder(int numOfPeople, int slicesPerPerson)
        {
            int numOfPizzas = (numOfPeople * slicesPerPerson)/8;
            /* INSERT CODE HERE */
        }
    
        public void printOrder(int number)
        {
            System.out.println("Order " + number + " pizzas ");
        }
    
    What of the following lines would go into ``/* INSERT CODE HERE */`` in line 4 in order to call the ``printOrder`` method to print the number of pizzas to order correctly?
    
    - printOrder(numOfPizzas);
    
      + Correct! If you had 8 people who want to eat 2 pizza slices each, numOfPizzas would be 8*2/8 = 2 pizzas, and printOrder would print out "Order 2 pizzas".
    
    - printOrder(numOfPeople);
    
      - This would always print out an order of how many people you have instead of how many calculated pizzas.
    
    - printOrder(2);
    
      - This would always print out "Order 2 pizzas" instead of the calculated number of pizzas.
    
    - printOrder(slicesPerPerson);
    
      - This would always print out an order of how many slices per person instead of how many calculated pizzas.
    
    - calculatePizzaOrder(numOfPizzas);
    
      - This would not call the printOrder method.
