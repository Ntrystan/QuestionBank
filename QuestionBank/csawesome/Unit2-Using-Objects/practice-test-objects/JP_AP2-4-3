    Consider the following methods, which appear in the same class.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public void fahrenheitToCelcius(double fTemp)
        {
            double cTemp = (fTemp − 32.0) * 5.0/9.0;
            printTemperature(fTemp, cTemp);
        }
    
        public void printTemperature(double fahrenheit, double celsius)
        {
            System.out.print(fahrenheit + "-->" + celsius);
        }
    
    Assume that the method call ``fahrenheitToCelcius(4.0)`` appears in a method in the same class. What is printed as a result of the method call?
    
    - 4.0 --> 35.0
    
      - (4°F − 32) × 5/9 = -20.0°C
    
    - -20.0 --> 4.0
    
      - Notice the order of parameters in printTemperature.
    
    - fahrenheit --> celsius
    
      - These are variables and their values would be printed.
    
    - 4 --> -20
    
      - The output values are doubles, not ints
    
    - 4.0 --> -20.0
    
      + Correct! (4 - 32) x 5/9 = -20.0 and doubles print out with .0 at the end.
