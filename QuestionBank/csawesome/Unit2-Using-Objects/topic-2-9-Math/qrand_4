   :answer_a: Math.random() < 0.25
   :answer_b: Math.random() > 0.25
   :answer_c: Math.random() == 0.25
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This is true about 25% of the time, since it will be a number from 0 to not quite 1.
   :feedback_b: This is true about 75% of the time, since it will be a number from 0 to not quite 1.
   :feedback_c: Do not use == with double values!  Remember that Math.random can return any number between 0 and not quite 1 (about .99999999).
