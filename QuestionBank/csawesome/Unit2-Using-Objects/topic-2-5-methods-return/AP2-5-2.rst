    Consider the following class definition.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public class Liquid
        {
            private double boilingPoint;
            private double freezingPoint;
            private double currentTemp;
    
            public Liquid()
            {
                currentTemp = 50;
            }
    
            public void lowerTemp()
            {
                currentTemp -= 10;
            }
    
            public double getTemp()
            {
                return currentTemp;
            }
        }
    
    Assume that the following code segment appears in a class other than Liquid.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        Liquid water = new Liquid();
        water.lowerTemp();
        System.out.println(water.getTemp());
    
    What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
    
    - \-10
    
      - The Liquid() constructor sets the currentTemp instance variable to 50 and the lowerTemp() method subtracts 10 from it.
    
    - 50
    
      - The Liquid() constructor sets the currentTemp instance variable to 50 and the lowerTemp() method subtracts 10 from it.
    
    - water.getTemp()
    
      - The System.out.println will print the value returned from water.getTemp().
    
    - The code will not compile.
    
      - This code should compile.
    
    - 40.0
    
      + Correct, the Liquid() constructor sets the currentTemp instance variable to 50 and the lowerTemp() method subtracts 10 from it, and getTemp() returns the currentTemp value as a double.
