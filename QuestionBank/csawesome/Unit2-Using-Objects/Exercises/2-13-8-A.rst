   :answer_a: Data Set 2 contains strings that should either return true or false
   :answer_b: Strings in Data Set 2 are all lowercase
   :answer_c: There are no advantages
   :answer_d: The strings in Data Set 2 have the same number of characters
   :answer_e: Data Set 1 has too many cases to test.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! This is an advantage since you will be able to tell whether the method works correctly for both a true and false return value.
   :feedback_b: This is probably a disadvantage.
   :feedback_c: Are all strings in Data Set 1 and 2 palindromes?
   :feedback_d: True, but not really an advantage.
   :feedback_e: It only has 1 more.
