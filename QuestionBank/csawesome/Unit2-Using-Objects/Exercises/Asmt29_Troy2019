   You will need to write four lines of code in the main() method to 
   complete this assignment.  main()  is located near the bottom
   of the code.

   Your program should create two java students
   and display the student information for each.
   ~~~~
    /**
     * The JavaStu class will allow you to create a JavaStu object
     * with a name and an email address.  
     * 
     * You can then print out the information about the student
     * using the printStu() method  
     *
     * @author (your name)
     * @version (a version number or a date)

    public class JavaStu
    {
        // instance variables
