   :feedback_a: Strings are immutable, meaning they don't change.  Any method that that changes a string returns a new string.  So s1 never changes unless you set it to a different string.
   :feedback_b: The substring method returns a new string starting at the first index and ending before the second index.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if we asked what the value of s2 was after the code executes.  What is the value of s1?
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we asked what the value of s3 was after the code executes.  What is the value of s1?
