    I.   if (score >= 90) grade = “A”;
         if (score >= 80 && score <= 89) grade = “B”;
         if (score >= 70 && score <= 79) grade = “C”;
         if (score < 70) grade = “F”;
   
    II.  if (score >= 90) grade = “A”;
         if (score >= 80) grade = “B”;
         if (score >= 70) grade = “C”;
         if (score < 70) grade = “F”;
   
    III. if (score >= 90) grade = “A”;
         else if (score >= 80) grade = “B”;
         else if (score >= 70) grade = “C”;
         else (score < 70) grade = “F”;
