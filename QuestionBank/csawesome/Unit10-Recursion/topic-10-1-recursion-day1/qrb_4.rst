   What is/are the values of the variable bunnies when this method stops calling itself (when it reaches the base case)?
   
    .. code-block:: java
      :linenos:
   
      public static int bunnyEars(int bunnies)
      {
         if (bunnies == 0) return 0;
         else if (bunnies == 1) return 2;
         else return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies - 1);
      }
