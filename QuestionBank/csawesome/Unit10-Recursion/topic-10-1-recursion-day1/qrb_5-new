   :answer_a: yes
   :answer_b: no
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Where is the call to the same method?
   :feedback_b: There is no call to the same method, so it is not recursive. This uses iteration instead.

   Is the following method recursive?

    .. code-block:: java
      :linenos:

      public static int bunnyEars(int bunnies)
      {
         int total = 0;
         for (int i = 0; i < bunnies; i++)
         {
            total = total + 2;
         }
         return total;
      }
