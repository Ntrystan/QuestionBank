   The following method should return the base multiplied power times. In otherwords, the base ^ power -- so exponent(2, 4) should return 16.  But the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
