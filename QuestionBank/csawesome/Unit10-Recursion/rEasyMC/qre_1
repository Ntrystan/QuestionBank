   :feedback_a: This is the method declaration.  Look for a call to the same method in the body of the method.
   :feedback_b: This is a conditional, not a method call.
   :feedback_c: This is a return statement, not a method call.
   :feedback_d: This line contains a call to the same method which makes this method recursive.
