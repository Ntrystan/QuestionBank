   You have money to spend on songs and audio books. Write a program to calculate how many audio books 
   you can purchase for a specified amount of money. 
   You specify the amount of money you want to spend, and the number of songs, then calculate
   how many audio books you can purchase with the left over funds.
   This time, be sure to use variables for the costs; $1.99 per song and $9.99 per audio book.
