   :feedback_a: 8 goes into 3 no times so the remainder is 3.  The remainder of a smaller number divided by a larger number is always the smaller number!
   :feedback_b: This would be the remainder if the question was 8 % 3 but here we are asking for the reminder after we divide 3 by 8.
   :feedback_c: What is the remainder after you divide 3 by 8?
