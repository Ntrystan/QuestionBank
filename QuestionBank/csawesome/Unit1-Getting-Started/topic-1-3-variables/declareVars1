   The following code declares and initializes variables for storing a number of visits, a person's temperature, and if the person has insurance or not.  It also includes extra blocks that are not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left area into the correct order (declaring numVisits, temp, and hasInsurance in that order) in the right area.  Click on the "Check Me" button to check your solution.
   -----
   int numVisits = 5;
   =====
   Int numVisits = 5; #paired
   =====
   double temp = 101.2;
   =====
   Double temp = 101.2;  #paired
   =====
   boolean hasInsurance = false;
   =====
   Boolean hasInsurance = false; #paired
