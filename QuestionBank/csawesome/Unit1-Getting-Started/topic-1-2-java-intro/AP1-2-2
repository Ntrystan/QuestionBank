    Consider the following code segment.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
       System.out.println("Roses are red, ")      // Line 1;
       System.out.println("Violets are blue, ")  // Line 2;
       System.out.print("Unexpected '}' ")        // Line 3;
       System.out.print("on line 32. ")           // Line 4;
    
    The code segment is intended to produce the following output but may not work as intended.
    
    .. raw:: html
    
       <pre>Roses are red,
       Violets are blue,
       Unexpected '}' on line 32.</pre>
    
    Which change, if any, can be made so that the code segment produces the intended output?
    
    - Replacing print with println on lines 3 and 4.
    
      - These should print on the same line without a newline in between.
    
    - Replacing println with print on lines 1 and 2.
    
      - These should print out with a newline in between.
    
    - Removing the single quotes in line 3.
    
      - The single quotes are fine in this line.
    
    - Putting the semicolon after the ) on each line.
    
      + Correct! The semicolon should go after each command but not in the comment.
