    Consider the following code segment.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
       System.out.print("Java is ");
       System.out.println("fun ");
       System.out.print("and cool!");
    
    What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
    
    - .. raw:: html
    
         <pre>Java is fun and cool!</pre>
    
      - Notice the println in line 2.
    
    - .. raw:: html
    
         <pre>
         Java isfun
         and cool!
         </pre>
    
      - Notice the space after is in the first line.
    
    - .. raw:: html
    
         <pre>Java is
         fun
         and cool!  </pre>
    
      - Notice that the first line is a print, not println.
    
    - .. raw:: html
    
         <pre>Java is fun
         and cool!  </pre>
    
      + Correct! Pay attention to which lines are print or println.
