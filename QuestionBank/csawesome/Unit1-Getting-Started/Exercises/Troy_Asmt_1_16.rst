   Write a program to determine the value of a bank account using 
   simple interest.   In your first pass design, you can assume the following 

   the initial balance is $500.00
    
   the interest rate is 3.5%    (You will need to use the decimal  0.035)  

   the time is 1 year (for simple interest, we will use an integer for time) 

   Interest Earned = Balance * Rate * Time 

    
   Declare a variable for each quantity:  balance, interest rate,  time, 
   interest earned, and the new balance 

   Display the new balance in a sentence.  


   WHEN YOU COMPLETE THIS ASSIGNMENT, copy the code to 
   BLUEJAY and get it running.   


   Add user input to the code using Scanner to scan the keyboard.   
   You must ask the user to input the initial balance, the interest rate, and 
   the time of the investment.  
   Then run your program with multiple input values to be sure it works.  


   Remember to show your esteemed instructor the working version of this
   code.
