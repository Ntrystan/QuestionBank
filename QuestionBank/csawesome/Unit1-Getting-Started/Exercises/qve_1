   :feedback_a: Whenever the first number is smaller than the second, the remainder is the first number.  Remember that % is the remainder and 3 goes into 2 0 times with a remainder of 2.
   :feedback_b: This is the number of times that 3 goes into 2 but the % operator gives you the remainder.
   :feedback_c: Try it.  Remember that % gives you the remainder after you divide the first number by the second one.
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if it was 3 % 2 since 2 would go into 3 one time with a remainder of 1.
