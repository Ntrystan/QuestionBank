   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was b = a.  What does the (int) do?
   :feedback_b: This is the initial value of b, but then b is assigned to be the result of casting the value in a to an integer. Casting to an integer from a double will truncate (throw away) the digits after the decimal.
   :feedback_c: Java does not round when converting from a double to an integer.
   :feedback_d: When a double is converted into an integer in Java, it truncates (throws away) the digits after the decimal.
