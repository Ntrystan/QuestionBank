   FUTURE PAY

   Write a program that:

    a. creates a variable 'name' and sets its value to your name.
    b. creates a variable 'age' and sets its value to some future age for you.
    c. creates a variable 'pay' and sets its value to the pay you hope to earn at that 
       future age. The pay should be dollars and cents - a decimal number.
    d. displays a statement like this: 

         My name Mr. Pataracchia and when I am, say, 58 years old,
         I hope to earn $65000.0 per year. (NO COMMAS IN THE NUMBER)
