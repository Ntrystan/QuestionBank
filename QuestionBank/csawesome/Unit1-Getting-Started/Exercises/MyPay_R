    Your program should set the variable 'name' to your name.

    It should set the variable 'age' to some future age for you.

    It should set the value of  'pay'  to the pay you hope to earn at that 
    future age.  The pay should be dollars and cents - a decimal number.

    Display a statement like this using only one line of sysout . You must use all the variables declared above in your sysout: 

    My name Dr. Haarererer and I am 42 years old.  

    I hope to earn $65000.0 per year.
