   Write a program that will calculate the cost of buying five items at 
   $16.95 each.  
   It will also calculate the HST tax at rate of 13% and add it to the 
   subtotal.  
   You will then need to display your output in a sentence or two, such as:  

   "You purchased 5 items at $16.95 each.
   The total cost, with tax, will be $19.15."   


   Your print statements must use variables for the following 
      a. number of items; 
      b. price; and
      c. total cost.

   You may also want variables for the 
      a. tax rate; 
      b. subtotal (the cost before tax); and
      c. dollar amount of tax.  

   After you get this program to work, change the price to $10.99 and the 
   number of items to 4 and run it again, making sure that it still works properly.  

   Bonus - make the TAXRATE a constant (i.e. final).  
   
   Recommendation:  Compile your program after every line or two you 
   code. It should make it much easier to fix compile time errors.
