   :answer_a: In line 1, print should be changed to println.
   :answer_b: In lines 2 and 3, println should be changed to print.
   :answer_c: The statement System.out.println() should be inserted between lines 2 and 3.
   :answer_d: In lines 1, 2, and 3, the text that appears in parentheses should be enclosed in quotation marks.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: The first and second sentences are printed on the same line so print() should be used on line 1.
   :feedback_b: The second and third lines are printed on different lines so println() should be used.
   :feedback_c: This would not resolve the error.
   :feedback_d: Yes! String literals must always be enclosed in quotes ("...").

       Consider the following code segment:
          System.out.print(I do not fear computers. );   // Line 1

          System.out.println(I fear the lack of them.);  // Line 2

          System.out.println(--Isaac Asimov);            // Line 3


       The code segment is intended to produce the following output but may not work as intended.

       I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.

       --Isaac Asimov
Which change, if any, can be made so that the code segment produces the intended output?
