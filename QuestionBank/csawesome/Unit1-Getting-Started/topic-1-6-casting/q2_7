   :answer_a: (double) (total / 3);
   :answer_b: total / 3;
   :answer_c: (double) total /  3;
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This does integer division before casting the result to double so it loses the fractional part.
   :feedback_b: When you divide an integer by an integer you get an integer result and lose the fractional part.
   :feedback_c: This will convert total to a double value and then divide by 3 to return a double result.

   Which of the following returns the correct average for a total that is the sum of 3 int values?
