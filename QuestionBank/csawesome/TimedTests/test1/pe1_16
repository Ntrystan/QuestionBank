   :answer_e: hI tHERE
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would only be correct if we had s1 = s2; after s2.toLowerCase(); was executed.  Strings are immutable and so any change to a string returns a new string.
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if we had s1 = s3; after s3.toUpperCase(); was executed.  Strings are immutable and so any change to a string returns a new string.
   :feedback_c: Strings are immutable meaning that any changes to a string creates and returns a new string, so the string referred to by s1 does not change
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we had s1 = s4; after s4 = null; was executed.  Strings are immutable and so any changes to a string returns a new string.
   :feedback_e: Strings are immutable and so any changes to a string returns a new string.

   Consider the following code.  What string is referenced by ``s1`` after the code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

      String s1 = "Hi There";
      String s2 = s1;
      String s3 = s2;
      String s4 = s1;
      s2 = s2.toLowerCase();
      s3 = s3.toUpperCase();
      s4 = null;
