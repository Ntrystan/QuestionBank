   :feedback_a: This is true, but at least one other thing is true as well.
   :feedback_b: This is true, but at least one other thing is true as well.
   :feedback_c: Selection sort always takes the same amount of time to execute.
   :feedback_d: Mergesort does use recursion (has a method that calls itself).  Insertion sort does take longer to execute when the items to be sorted are in ascending order and you want them in descending order.
   :feedback_e: Selection sort always takes the same amount of time to execute.
