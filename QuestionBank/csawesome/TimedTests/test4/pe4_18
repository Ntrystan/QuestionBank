   :answer_a: s={3, 8}; b=4;
   :answer_b: s={3, 4}; b=4;
   :answer_c: s={6, 4}; b=4;

   :answer_e: s={6, 8}; b=8;
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The value of a[1] will be doubled since passing a copy of the value of s is a copy of the reference to the array.  The value in b won't change since y will be set to a copy of b's value which is just a number.
   :feedback_b: What about a[1] = a[1] * 2?
   :feedback_c: Remember that the first index in an array is index 0.  This code will double the second value in the array (the one at index 1).
   :feedback_d: Java passes arguments by creating a copy of the current value so the value of b won't be affected by changes to y.
   :feedback_e: Java passes arguments by creating a copy of the current value so the value of b won't be affected by changes to y.

   Consider the following method and code.  What are the values of s and b after the following has executed?

   .. code-block:: java

     public static void test(int[] a, int y)
     {
        if (a.length > 1)
           a[1] = a[1] * 2;
        y = y * 2;
     }

     int[] s = {3,4};
     int b = 4;
     test(s,b);
