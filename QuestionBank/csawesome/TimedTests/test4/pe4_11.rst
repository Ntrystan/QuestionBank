   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if we asked what the value of s3 was.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if we asked what the value of s2 was.
   :feedback_c: Strings are immutable in Java which means they never change.  Any method that looks like it changes a string returns a new string object.  Since s1 was never changed to refer to a different string it stays the same.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we asked what the value of s4 was.
   :feedback_e: How could this have happened?
