   :feedback_a: The first line is the same as 3y.  Then you have to substitute in the new value of y in the second line (2 * 3y + 3y) = 6y + 3y = 9y.
   :feedback_b: Remember that the second line is using the value of y calculated in the first line for both places y appears.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the body only had the last line in it.  What do the first 2 lines do?
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the it was missing the second line.  What does that line do?
   :feedback_e: Remember that 2 * y + y is the same as 3 * y.
