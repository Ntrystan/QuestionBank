   :answer_a: !(a && b)
   :answer_b: !a && b
   :answer_c: !a && !b
   :answer_d: a && b
   :answer_e: a || !b
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if a or b are false using De Morgan's laws: !(a && b) = !a || !b.
   :feedback_b: If b was false, this option would be false.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: This will only be true only when both a and b are true.
   :feedback_e: This will only be true if a is true, or b is false.

   Which option will evaluate to true, if and only if both a and b are false?
