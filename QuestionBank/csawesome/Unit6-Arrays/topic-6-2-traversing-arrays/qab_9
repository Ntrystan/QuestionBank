   :feedback_a: This would true if it looped through the whole array and doubled each.  Does it?
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it looped from the beginning to the middle and doubled each.  Does it?
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it looped from the middle to the end and doubled each.  Does it?
   :feedback_d: This loops from the beginning to the middle and doubles every other element (i+=2 is the same as i = i + 2).
   :feedback_e: This would be true if it looped through the whole array and doubled every other element.  Does it?

   Given the following values of a and the method mystery what will the values of a be after you execute: mystery()?
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
      private int[ ] a = {-20, -15, 2, 8, 16, 33};
   
      public void mystery()
      {
   
         for (int i = 0; i < a.length/2; i+=2)
         {
            a[i] = a[i] * 2;
         }
      }
