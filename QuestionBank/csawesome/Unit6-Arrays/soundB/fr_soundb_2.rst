     :answer_c: int[] samples2 = new int[count];
     :correct: c
     :feedback_a: This only declares the variable samples2 which will refer to an array of integers, it doesn't create the array object.
     :feedback_b: The new keyword is not used to create an array.
     :feedback_c: This will create an array of integers of size count and a variable named samples2 which will refer to that array.

     Which is the correct code for creating an integer array variable named ``samples2`` and setting it to refer to an array of integers of size ``count``?
