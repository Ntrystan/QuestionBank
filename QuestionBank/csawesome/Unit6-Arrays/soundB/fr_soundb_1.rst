     :feedback_a: A while loop is the best choice when you don't know the number of times you need to loop.
     :feedback_b: You could use a for loop, but typically a while loop is used when you want to loop while a condition is true.
     :feedback_c: A for-each loop would only allow you to loop through all the values, but you first want to loop while there are leading zeros.
