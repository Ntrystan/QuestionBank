   The following program segment is a method that should return an integer array that is "right shifted" by one -- so {6, 2, 5, 3} returns {3, 6, 2, 5} (the parameter). Note that the method return type is int[] which means it will return an int array. But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution. </p>
