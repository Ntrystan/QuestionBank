   The following program segment should double each element in the array then print out the new value -- so (1,2,3,4,5) should become (2,4,6,8,10).  But, the blocks have been mixed up.  Drag the blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
