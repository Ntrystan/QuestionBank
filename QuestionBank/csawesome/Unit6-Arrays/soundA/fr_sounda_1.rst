     :feedback_a: You could use a while loop, but if you are looping through all values in an array it is better to use a for loop.  It is easier to make mistakes with a while loop and forget to increment a value in the body of the loop so that the loop eventually stops.
     :feedback_b: Use a for loop when you want to loop through all or part of an array and need to change some of the values in the array.
     :feedback_c: You could use a for-each loop to loop through all of the values in the array, but you wouldn't be able to change the values.
