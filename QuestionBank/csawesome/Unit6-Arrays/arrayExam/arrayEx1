   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: While i is set to 0 initially it does change.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if i was incremented after the sum was changed instead of before.
   :feedback_c: This will loop twice and increment i each time so at the end i is 2.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was asking for the value of limit.

   What is the value of ``i`` after the following code has executed?


   .. code-block:: java

     int[] x = {2, 1, 4, 5, 7};
     int limit = 3;
     int i = 0;
     int sum = 0;
     while ((sum < limit) && (i < x.length))
     {
        i++;
        sum = sum + x[i];
     }
