   :feedback_a: Each time the loop executes i is incremented and it executes at least once.
   :feedback_b: Does this code only execute 1 time?
   :feedback_c: This code will loop till sum is not less than limit.  It adds the value at i of x each time to sum so sum isn't 7 until the 3rd time through the loop.
   :feedback_d: This will loop three times till sum is 7 and so i will be 3.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if it was <code>sum <= limit</code>.

   What is the value of ``i`` after the following code executes?
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
      int[] x = {2, 1, 4, 5, 7};
      int limit = 7;
      int i = 0;
      int sum = 0;
      while ((sum<limit) && (i<x.length))
      {
         sum += x[i];
         i++;
      }
