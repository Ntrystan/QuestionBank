   :feedback_a: Strings are immutable and so any changes to a string returns a new string.
   :feedback_b: This would only be correct if we had s1 = s2; after s2.toLowerCase(); was executed. Strings are immutable and so any change to a string returns a new string.
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if we had s1 = s3; after s3.toUpperCase(); was executed. Strings are immutable and so any change to a string returns a new string.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we had s1 = s4; after s4 = null; was executed. Strings are immutable and so any changes to a string returns a new string.
   :feedback_e: Strings are immutable meaning that any changes to a string creates and returns a new string, so the string referred to by s1 does not change

   Given the following code segment, what will the value of ``s1`` be after this executes?
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
     String s1 = "Hi There";
     String s2 = s1;
     String s3 = s2;
     String s4 = s1;
     s2 = s2.toLowerCase();
     s3 = s3.toUpperCase();
     s4 = null;
