   :answer_c: The getAge method should have at least one parameter.

   :answer_e: The instance variable age should be returned instead of a, which is local to the constructor.
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: The method should be public so it can be accessed outside of the class.
   :feedback_b: The method return type should stay as int.
   :feedback_c: The getAge should not take any parameters.
   :feedback_d: This is an instance variable and should be declared outside.
   :feedback_e: The accessor method getAge should return the instance variable age.

    Consider the following Cat class, with the cat’s age stored in the method’s int attribute. The getAge method is intended to allow methods in other classes to access a Cat object’s age value; however, it does not work as intended. Which of the following best explains why the getAge method does NOT work as intended?

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Cat
        {
            private int age;

            public Cat(int a)
            {
                age = a;
            }

            public int getAge()
            {
                return a;
            }
        }
