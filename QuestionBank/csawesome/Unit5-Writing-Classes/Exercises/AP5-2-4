    Consider the definition of the Party class below. The class uses the instance variable numOfPeople to indicate how many people are at the party.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public class Party
        {
            private int numOfPeople;
            private String partyHost;
    
            public Party (String name, int people)
            {
                partyHost = name;
                numOfPeople = people;
            }
        }
    
        Which of the following statements will create a Party object
        that represents a party that has three people at it?
    
    - Party p = new Party ("Natasha", "3");
    
      - An int should be passed in as the second parameter, not a String.
    
    - Party p = new Party ("Eduardo", 3);
    
      + Correct
    
    - Party p = new Party ("Emillio", "three");
    
      - An int should be passed in as the second parameter, not a string.
    
    - Party p = new Party ("Bob", three);
    
      - The word three would be treated as an undeclared variable here.
    
    - Party p = new Party ("Billie", "2+1");
    
      - Strings cannot perform addition.
