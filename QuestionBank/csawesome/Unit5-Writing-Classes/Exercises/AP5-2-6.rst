    Consider the following class definition.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public class Party
        {
            private int numOfPeople;
            private double volumeOfMusic;
            /* missing constructor */
        }
    
    The following statement appears in a method in a class other than Party. It is intended to create a new Party object p with its attributes set to 10 and 5.0.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
         Party p = new Party(10, 5.0);
    
         Which of the following can be used to replace /* missing constructor */
         so that the object p is correctly created?
    
    - .. code-block:: java
    
        public Party(int first, double second)
        {
            numOfPeople = 10;
            volumeOfMusic = 5.0;
        }
    
      - The constructor should be using the local variables to set the instance variables.
    
    - .. code-block:: java
    
        public Party(int first, double second)
        {
            numOfPeople = first;
            volumeOfMusic = second;
        }
    
      + Correct
    
    - .. code-block:: java
    
        public Party(int first, double second)
        {
            first = 10;
            second = 5.0;
        }
    
      - The constructor should be using the parameters to set the instance variables.
    
    - .. code-block:: java
    
        public Party(int first, double second)
        {
            first = numOfPeople;
            second = volumeOfMusic;
        }
    
      - The constructor should be changing the instance variables, not the local variables.
