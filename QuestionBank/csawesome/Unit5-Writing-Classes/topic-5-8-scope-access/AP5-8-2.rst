    Consider the following class definition.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public class Movie
        {
            private int currentPrice;
            private int movieRating;
    
            public Movie(int p, int r)
            {
                currentPrice = p;
                movieRating = r;
            }
    
            public int getCurrentPrice()
            {
                int currentPrice = 16;
                return currentPrice;
            }
    
            public void printPrice()
            {
                System.out.println(getCurrentPrice());
            }
        }
    
    Which of the following reasons explains why the printPrice method is "broken" and only ever prints out a value of 16?
    
    - The private variables currentPrice and movieRating are not properly initialized.
    
      - The constructor will initialize them.
    
    - The private variables currentPrice and movieRating should have been declared public.
    
      - Instance variables should be private.
    
    - The printPrice method should have been declared as private.
    
      - Methods are usually public.
    
    - currentPrice is declared as a local variable in the getCurrentPrice method and set to 16, and will be used instead of the instance variable currentPrice.
    
      + Correct!
    
    - The currentPrice instance variable does not have a value.
    
      - Accessor methods are usually public.
