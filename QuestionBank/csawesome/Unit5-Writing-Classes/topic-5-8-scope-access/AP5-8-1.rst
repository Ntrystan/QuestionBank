        {

            public void orderMoreFood(int additionalFoodBoxes)
            {
                int updatedAmountOfFood = boxesOfFood + additionalFoodBoxes;
                boxesOfFood = updatedAmountOfFood;
            }
   
            public void eatFoodBoxes(int eatenBoxes)
            {
                boxesOfFood = updatedAmountOfFood - eatenBoxes;
            }
        }
