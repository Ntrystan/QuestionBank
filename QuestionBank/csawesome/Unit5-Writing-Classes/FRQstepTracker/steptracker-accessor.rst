     :answer_a: StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(1000)
     :answer_b: tr.addDailysteps(1000);
     :answer_c: tr.activeDays();
     :correct: c
     :feedback_a: This is a call to the constructor.
     :feedback_b: No, addDailySteps(1000) probably adds the given steps to an instance variable as a mutator method.
     :feedback_c: Yes, activeDays() is an accessor method that returns the number of active days (a great instance variable!).
