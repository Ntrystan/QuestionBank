    Consider the definition of the Cat class below. The class uses the instance variable isSenior to indicate whether a cat is old enough to be considered a senior cat or not.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public class Cat
        {
            private String name;
            private int age;
            private boolean isSenior;
            public Cat(String n, int a)
            {
                name = n;
                age = a;
                if (age >= 10)
                {
                    isSenior = true;
                }
                else
                {
                    isSenior = false;
                }
            }
        }
    
    Which of the following statements will create a Cat object that represents a cat that is considered a senior cat?
    
    - Cat c = new Cat ("Oliver", 7);
    
      - The age 7 is less than 10, so this cat would not be considered a senior cat.
    
    - Cat c = new Cat ("Max", "15");
    
      - An integer should be passed in as the second parameter, not a string.
    
    - Cat c = new Cat ("Spots", true);
    
      - An integer should be passed in as the second parameter, not a boolean.
    
    - Cat c = new Cat ("Whiskers", 10);
    
      + Correct!
    
    - Cat c = new Cat ("Bella", isSenior);
    
      - An integer should be passed in as the second parameter and isSenior would be undefined outside of the class.
