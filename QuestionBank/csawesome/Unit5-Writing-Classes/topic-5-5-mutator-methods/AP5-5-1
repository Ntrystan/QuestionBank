    Consider the following class definition.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public class Liquid
        {
            private int currentTemp;
    
            public Liquid(int temp)
            {
                currentTemp = temp;
            }
    
            public void resetTemp()
            {
                currentTemp = newTemp;
            }
        }
    
    Which of the following best identifies the reason the class does not compile?
    
    - The constructor header does not have a return type.
    
      - The constructor should not have a return type.
    
    - The resetTemp method is missing a return type.
    
      - Mutator methods usually have a void return type.
    
    - The constructor should not have a parameter.
    
      - Constructors can have parameters.
    
    - The resetTemp method should have a parameter.
    
      + Correct! The resetTemp method should have a parameter for the newTemp value to set the currentTemp.
    
    - The instance variable currentTemp should be public instead of private.
    
      - Instance variables should be private variables.
