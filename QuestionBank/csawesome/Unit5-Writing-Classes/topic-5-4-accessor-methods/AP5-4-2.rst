    Consider the following class definition. The class does not compile.
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
        public class Student
        {
            private int id;
            public getId()
            {
                return id;
            }
            // Constructor not shown
        }
    
    The accessor method getId is intended to return the id of a Student object. Which of the following best explains why the class does not compile?
    
    - The id instance variable should be public.
    
      - Instance variables should be private.
    
    - The getId method should be declared as private.
    
      - Accessor methods should be public methods.
    
    - The getId method requires a parameter.
    
      - Accessor methods usually do not require parameters.
    
    - The return type of the getId method needs to be defined as void.
    
      - void is not the correct return type.
    
    - The return type of the getId method needs to be defined as int.
    
      + Correct! Accessor methods have a return type of the instance variable they are returning.
