   :answer_a: (int) (Math.random() + 1) * 50
   :answer_b: (int) (Math.random() * 50) + 1
   :answer_c: (int) (Math.random() + 1 * 50)
   :answer_d: (int) Math.random() * 50
   :answer_e: (int) (Math.random() * 50)
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This always returns 50. Math.random() + 1 calculates a value between 1 and 1.9, and when this value is cast as an int it becomes 1. 1 * 50 always returns 50.
   :feedback_b: This calculates a random number between 1 and 50, but indexes of arrays start at 0 and end at array.length - 1.
   :feedback_c: This always returns 50. 1 * 50 returns 50 since multiplication takes precedence befores addition. The value of Math.random() + 50 always falls between 50.0 and 50.9, and this value becomes 50 when it is cast as an int.
   :feedback_d: This always returns 0, since Math.random() returns a value between 0 and 0.9. When the value of Math.random() is cast an int, its value becomes 0. 0 * 50 returns 0.
   :feedback_e: This correctly calculates a random index between 0 and 49 for the array.

   You have an array ``values`` filled with 50 integers. Which of the following correctly produces a random index of ``values``?
