   :answer_a: The method will produce an infinite loop.

   :answer_e: 18
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Eventually, the recursive calls will reach mystery(5). 5 is less than 10, so the base case will have been reached and the method will end.
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if the method found the sum of the digits in the given value, with an extra 1. Instead, the method finds the number of digits.
   :feedback_c: This method finds the number of digits in num.
   :feedback_d: This method finds the number of digits in num. Check your recursive call to make sure you reached the base case correctly.
   :feedback_e: This would be correct if the method added the digits in the value. Instead, the method simply finds the number of digits. Check the recursive call again.

   Given the following code, what is returned by mystery(5364)?

   .. code-block:: java

     public static int mystery(int num)
     {
        if (num < 10)
        {
           return 1;
        }

        else
        {
           return 1 + mystery(num / 10);
        }
     }
