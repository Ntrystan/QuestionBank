   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This is what would happen with two iterations of selection sort. Remember that selection sort only swaps two elements at a time, while insertion sort places elements in order in the sorted part of the array.
   :feedback_b: This is what would happen if selection sort was used instead of insertion sort. Remember that selection sort only swaps two elements at a time, while insertion sort places elements in order in the sorted part of the array.
   :feedback_c: This is what the array looks like after the second iteration. Do one more iteration.
   :feedback_d: Using insertion sort, we start at the first index and sort the first two values to create a sorted array at the left side of the array. We repeat this step for the second index, creating a sorted array of three elements, and again for the third index, creating a sorted array of four elements.
   :feedback_e: This is the final sorted array. Instead of three passes, it takes seven iterations to reach this state.


   Consider an array of integers that contains ``[12, 8, 4, 6, 13, 29, 7]``. If the array is sorted from smallest to largest using an insertion sort method, what will be the order of the array after the third iteration of the sorting method?
