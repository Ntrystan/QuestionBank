   :answer_e: I, II, and III
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: The color is a private instance variable in Bird. Children classes do not have direct access to private variables.  They must use the public getter and setter methods to access the private variables.
   :feedback_b: The public eat method was inherited from the Bird class and can be called from code in the Swan class.
   :feedback_c: Constructors are not inherited by sub classes. Only public accessor and mutator methods are inherited by sub classes.
   :feedback_d: II is correct, but I is incorrect. Private instance variables cannot be directly accessed by the child class.
   :feedback_e: II is correct, but I and III are incorrect. Constructors are not inherited and subclasses do not have direct access to private instance variables.

   Consider the following class declarations. Which of the following code can be executed in the ``Swan`` class?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Bird
      {
          private String color;

          public Bird(String theColor)
          {
              /* implementation not shown */
          }

          public void makeNoise()
          {
              /* implementation not shown */
          }

          public void eat()
          {
              /* implementation not shown */
          }

          public string showFeathers()
          {
              return color;
          }
      }

      public class Swan extends Bird
      {
          /* no constructors or other methods have been declared */
      }


      I. this.color = "blue";

      II. eat();

      III. Swan s = new Swan("blue");
