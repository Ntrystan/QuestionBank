     :feedback_a: Correct! While loops are perfect when you don't always need to loop through the whole list.
     :feedback_b: Try again. For loops are typically used when it is necessary to access every element in a list.
     :feedback_c: Try again. For each loops automatically loop through every element in a list, but this problem doesn't require that.
