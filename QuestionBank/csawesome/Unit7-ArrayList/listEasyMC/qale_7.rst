   :feedback_a: This would add 0 at index 2.  Remember that the method is <code>add(index, obj)</code>.
   :feedback_b: This would add 1 at index 2.  Remember that the method is <code>add(index, obj)</code>
   :feedback_c: This would add 2 at index 0 which would result in <code>[2, 1, 3, 4]</code>
   :feedback_d: This would add 2 at index 1 which would result in <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code>
   :feedback_e: This would add 2 at index 2 which would result in <code>[1, 3, 2, 4]</code>
