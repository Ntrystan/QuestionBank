   :answer_c: for-each
   :answer_d: while
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! This method will be the easiest to read and simplest to debug.
   :feedback_b: you cannot use a single for loop because you need to traverse 2 dimensions
   :feedback_c: you could use a nested for-each loop but it would make your code longer and less efficient, as well as harder to read.
   :feedback_d: you cannot use a single while loop because you need to traverse 2 dimensions
