   :answer_a: if (locToCheck == null)
   :answer_b: if (grid.get(locToCheck) == null)
   :answer_c: if (locs.get(locToCheck) == 0)
   :answer_d: if (grid.get(locToCheck) == 0)
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: locToCheck currently only contains the location in the grid, not what object is actually located there
   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: We want locs to contain all the empty locations so it wouldn't make sense to call locs.get(locToCheck).
   :feedback_d: The grid could contain an integer object equal to 0 so that would mean the grid isn't empty at that spot.

   How can you check if the current location, "locToCheck" is empty?
