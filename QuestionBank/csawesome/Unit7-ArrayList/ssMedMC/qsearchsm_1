   :feedback_a: The insertion sort starts at index 1 and inserts each value into the sorted list to the left by moving any larger values right.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was a selection sort.
   :feedback_c: This looks like an insertion sort, but it is missing one step.
   :feedback_d: This looks like a selection sort, but it is missing one step.
   :feedback_e: This is more like a selection sort, but not a correct one.
