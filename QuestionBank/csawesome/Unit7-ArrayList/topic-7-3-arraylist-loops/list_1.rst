   The following has the correct code for the method <code>getScore</code> plus at least one extra unneeded code statement.  This method will calculate and return the score for a word game.  The code should loop through all of the elements in <code>wordList</code> and if the length of the current word is 3 it should add one to the <code>score</code>, if the length of the word is 4 it should add 2 to the <code>score</code>, and if the length is greater than 4 it should add 3 to the <code>score</code>.  The method should return the <code>score</code>.  Drag the needed blocks from the left into the correct order on the right. Check your solution by clicking on the <i>Check Me</i> button.  You will be told if any of the blocks are in the wrong order or if you need to remove one or more blocks.  There is one extra block that is not needed in a correct solution.
