   :answer_a: s1 == s3 && s1.equals(s3)
   :answer_b: !(s1 == s2) && !(s1 == s3)
   :answer_c: s2.equals(s3) && s1.equals(s3)
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Since s3 uses the new operator it will not refer to the same object as s1.
   :feedback_b: Do s2 and s3 have the same characters in the same order?
   :feedback_c: All of the variables refer to different objects.  But, s1.equals(s3) would be true since they have the same characters in the same order.
