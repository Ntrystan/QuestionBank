   :feedback_a: Since x is less than 6, x is  doubled to 6. Then, since  that result is greater than 4, x is set to 2 in the second if statement.
   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: Since x is less than 6, x is  doubled to 6. Then, since  that result is greater than 4, x is set to 2 in the second if statement.
   :feedback_d: Since x is less than 6, x is  doubled to 6. Then, since  that result is greater than 4, x is set to 2 in the second if statement.
   :feedback_e: This code will compile.

   Consider the following code segment. What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
     int x = 3;
     if (x < 6)
     {
         x = x * 2;
     }
     if (x >= 4)
     {
        x = 2;
     }
     System.out.print(x);
