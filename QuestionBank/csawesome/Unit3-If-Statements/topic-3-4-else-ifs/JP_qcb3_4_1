   :answer_a: x is negative
   :answer_b: x is zero
   :answer_c: x is positive
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This will only print if x is less than zero.  Is it?
   :feedback_b: This will only print if x has been set to 0.  Has it?
   :feedback_c: This will only print if x is greater than zero.  Is it?

   What does the following code print when x has been set to 3?

   .. code-block:: java

     if (x < 0)
     {
        System.out.println("x is negative");
     }
     else if (x == 0)
     {
        System.out.println("x is zero");
     }
     else
     {
        System.out.println("x is positive");
     }
