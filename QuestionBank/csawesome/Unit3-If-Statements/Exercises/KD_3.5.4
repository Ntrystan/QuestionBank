   :answer_a: Any value less than 10
   :answer_b: Any value less than 10 except for 5
   :answer_c: The only time it is false is when x = 5.
   :answer_d: Any value greater than or equal to 10
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Let x = 3. 3 < 10 and 3 != 5. Both conditions are true, so it would evaluate to true.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. Let x = 3. 3 < 10 and 3 != 5. Both conditions are true, so it would evaluate to true.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. It will evaluate to false when x = 5 but thats not the only time.
   :feedback_d: Correct!

   What value of x would make this boolean expression evaluate to false?

   .. code-block:: java

     (x < 10) && (x != 5)
