   :feedback_a: Notice that each of the first 4 statements start with an if.  What will actually be printed?  Try it.
   :feedback_b: Each of the first 4 if statements will execute.
   :feedback_c: Check this in DrJava.
   :feedback_d: Each of the if statements will be executed. So grade will be set to B then C and finally D.
   :feedback_e: This will only be true when score is less than 60.

   What is the value of grade when the following code executes and score is 80?

   .. code-block:: java

     if (score >= 90) grade = "A";
     if (score >= 80) grade = "B";
     if (score >= 70) grade = "C";
     if (score >= 60) grade = "D";
     else grade = "E";
