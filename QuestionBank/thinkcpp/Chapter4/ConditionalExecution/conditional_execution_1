   :answer_a: Change the value of x to be anything less than 6.
   :answer_b: Change the value of x to 13.
   :answer_c: Change the sign of the last conditional statement to x > 6.
   :answer_d: Change the value of the return from 0 to "Bigger!"
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: While "Bigger" would now print, the other two statements would not!
   :feedback_b: Now, none of the statements would print!
   :feedback_c: Now, all of the statements would print.
   :feedback_d: main returns an int, so trying to make it return a string will cause an error.

   Observe the code above. "Bigger" never prints! How can you modify this so that all of the statements print?
