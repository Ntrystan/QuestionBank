    What is printed when the following code executes?
    
    ::
    
        int x = 8;
    
        if (x % 3 == 2) {
            cout << "hey!" << endl;
        }
        else if (x != 7) {
            cout << "hi!" << endl;
        }
        else if (x % 2 == 0) {
            cout << "hello!" << endl;
        }
        else {
            cout << "bye!" << endl;
        }
    
    -   ::
    
            hey!
    
        +   Since the first conditon is met, the rest of the chained
            conditional does not execute.
    
    -   ::
    
            hi!
    
        -   It's true that ``8 != 7``, but "hi!" is not printed here.
    
    -   ::
    
            hi!
    
        -   It's true that ``8 % 2 == 0``, but "hello!" is not printed!
    
    -   ::
    
            hey!
            hi!
            hello!
    
        -   All of these conditons are met, but only one expression is
            printed!
    
    -   ::
    
            bye!
    
        -   At least one of the conditons is met, so the ``else`` will not
            execute!
