    Say you run the following code.  What is the value of ``mod``?
    
    ::
    
        int x = 4;
        int y = 7;
        int mod = y % x;
    
    -   0
    
        -   There *is* a remainder.
    
    -   1
    
        -   Incorrect!
    
    -   2
    
        -   Incorrect!
    
    -   3
    
        +   The remainder of ``7 / 4`` is 3.
    
    -   4
    
        -   We can't have a remainder of 4, since 4 is the divisor.
