    Suppose you have defined the following function:
    
    ::
    
        void practicingReturns (int a, int b) {
            if (a < b) {
                a += 2;
            }
            if (a > b) {
                return;
            }
            cout << a + b;
        }
    
    What is printed when we run the following code?
    
    ::
    
        int x = practicingReturns(2, 3);
    
    -   5
    
        -   This is what ``a + b`` would be before the first conditonal.
    
    -   7
    
        -   This is the value of ``a + b`` after the first conditional, but it
            doesn't print.
    
    -   23
    
        -   This is not the value of ``a + b``.
    
    -   Nothing.
    
        +   The function exits with a return before anything is printed.
