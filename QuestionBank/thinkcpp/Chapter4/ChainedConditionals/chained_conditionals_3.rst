   :feedback_a: Make note of the use of "if" instead of "else if" or "else".
   :feedback_b: When we have "if" statments, but no "else if" or "else", every condition will be checked.
   :feedback_c: The first statement will not be executed because x > 8 is not true.  Also, make note of the use of "if" instead of "else if" or "else".
   :feedback_d: The first statement will not be executed because x > 8 is not true.
