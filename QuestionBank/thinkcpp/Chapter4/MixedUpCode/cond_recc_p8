   If a cat is in a good mood, it purrs; when it's in a bad mood, it
   meows.  If a doog is in a good mood, it barks; when it's in a bad
   mood it woofs.  Construct a function that accomplishes this.

   void makeVocals (string animal, string mood) {
   =====
    if (mood == "bad") {

     if (animal == "dog") {
