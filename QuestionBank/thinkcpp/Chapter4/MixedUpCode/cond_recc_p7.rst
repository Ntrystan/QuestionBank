   According to a logic game, a knight is someone who cannot tell a lie,
   and a knave is someone who cannot tell the truth.  Construct a function
   that takes two booleans: the truth value of the story, and the truth value
   told by the person.  The function should print whether the person was a
   knight or a knave.

   void knightKnave (bool truth, bool told) {
   =====
    if (truth == true) {
   =====
     if (told == true) {
      cout << "Knight";
     }
   =====
     else {
      cout << "Knave";
     } }
   =====
    else {
   =====
     if (told == true) {
      cout << "Knave";
     }
   =====
     else {
      cout << "Knive";
     } }
