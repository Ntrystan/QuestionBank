   :caption: Even or Odd?

   This program shows you how the print parity function works.
   Feel free to modify the values of number and otherNumber to
   see how the output is changed.

   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void printParity (int x) {
       if (x % 2 == 0) {
           cout << "x is even" << endl;
       }
       else {
           cout << "x is odd" << endl;
       }
   }

   int main () {
       int number = 17;
       printParity(number);
       int otherNumber = 18;
       printParity(otherNumber);
       return 0;
   }
