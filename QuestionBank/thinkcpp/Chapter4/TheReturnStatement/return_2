   :feedback_a: Take a look at the first conditional statement more closely.
   :feedback_b: 8 is not greater than 8, so it doesn't meet the first condition.
   :feedback_c: All of the following are "if" statements, with no return. There are no "else" statements.
   :feedback_d: All of the following are "if" statements, with no return. There are no "else" statements.
   :feedback_e: Take a look at the first conditional statement more closely.

   What will print?

   ::

       #include <iostream>
       using namespace std;

       int main () {
         int x = 8;
         if (x > 8) {
           cout << "One! ";
         }
         if (x > 6) {
           cout << "Two! ";
         }
         if (x > 3) {
           cout << "Three!" << endl;
         }
         return 0;
