   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! This is the size of the vector before we ran the command.
   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: Incorrect!
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! We are adding the element 3 to the end of the vector, not 3 elements!

   Let **nums** be the vector { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }. If we run the command ``nums.push_back(3)``, what will be returned by ``nums.size()``?
