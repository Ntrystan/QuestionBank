   :answer_a: a method of programming where you write simple "helper" functions that are later incorporated into larger functions
   :answer_b: a method of programming in which you tackle the largest functions first, and save the simple functions for later
   :answer_c: a method of programming where you break the task down into smaller and smaller components until it cannot be simplified further
   :answer_d: a method of programming where you use the minimum number of functions to accomplish the task
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! Bottom-up design starts with a lot of small functions and assembles them into a few larger ones that accomplish a task.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! This is describing top-down design.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! This is describing top-down design.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! Bottom-up design uses many simple functions rather than a few complex ones, so it is not minimizing the number of functions being used.

   Which of the following is the best definition of bottom-up design?
