   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: Your code runs without a problem because counters are automatically initialized to zero.
   :answer_b: Your code might run, but it probably won't produce the output you desire.
   :answer_c: You might get an error for using an uninitialized variable.
   :answer_d: Your program will crash.
   :correct: b,c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! Variables are not automatically initialized.
   :feedback_b: Correct! C++ might assign unused memory to the uninitialized variable, which will allow the code to run, but counts may be off.
   :feedback_c: Correct! Depening on your compiler, you might be lucky enough to get an error message.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! You might get a compile error, but your program will not crash.

   What happens if you don't initialize a counter?
