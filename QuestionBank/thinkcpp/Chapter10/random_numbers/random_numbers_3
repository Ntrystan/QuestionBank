   :answer_a: int y = x / 12
   :answer_b: int y = x % 12
   :answer_c: int y = x / 13
   :answer_d: int y = x % 13
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! This returns some random number between 0 and x / 12, which is out of range.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! This returns a random number between 0 and 11.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! This returns some random number between 0 and x / 13, which is out of range.
   :feedback_d: Correct!

   If we wanted to generate a random number between 0 and 12, and we have previously declared int ``int x = random ();``, what should be our next line of code?
