   :answer_a: Perform arithmetic.
   :answer_b: Include a mapping as part of the program.
   :answer_c: Use the same set of values in multiple mappings.
   :answer_d: Define the set of values that make up a mapping.
   :answer_e: Use them as indices for a vector.
   :correct: b,d,e
   :feedback_a: We are not allowed to do arithmetic with enumerated types.
   :feedback_b: This is the purpose of an enumerated type.
   :feedback_c: Variables in one enumeration type cannot be used in another enumeration type.
   :feedback_d: This is the purpose of an enumerated type.
   :feedback_e: Since the values in enumerated types are represented as integers, we can use them as vector indices.
