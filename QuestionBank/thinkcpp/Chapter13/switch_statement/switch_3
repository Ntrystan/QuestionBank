   :answer_d: Invalid num! Please try again.
   :answer_e: Code will not run.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! Try running it with the active code.
   :feedback_b: Case 2 doesn't end with a break statement, so case 3 also runs!
   :feedback_c: Where do we encounter a break statement?
   :feedback_d: Is 2 one of the invalid numbers?
   :feedback_e: There is no reason why the code wouldn't run.

   What is the correct output of the code below?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      int main() {
        int num = 2;

        switch (num) {
        case 1:
          cout << 1;
          break;
        case 2:
          cout << 4;
        case 3:
          cout << 9;
          break;
        default:
          cout << "Invalid num! Please try again.";
          break;
        }
      }
