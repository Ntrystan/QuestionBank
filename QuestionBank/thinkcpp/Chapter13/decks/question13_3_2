   :feedback_a: Incorrect! Look at the values of ``suit`` and ``rank`` in the state diagram for each card.
   :feedback_b: Correct! We'll see how to initialize each card in a deck in the next section.

   Take a look at the state diagram above. When we create a deck of cards using ``Deck deck (52)``,
   the cards will be initialized to the correct suits and ranks of a standard deck of 52 cards.
