   Fix the code below so that it prints "Cady scored 0.9 on the exam."
   Although this isn't how we'd usually tell people our scores, 0.9 is
   the C++ way of expressing 90%.
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   int main() {
       int Cady = (3 * 5) * 6 / 100;
       cout << "Cady scored" << Cady <<"on the exam.";
   }
