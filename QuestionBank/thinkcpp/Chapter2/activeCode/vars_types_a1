   Fix the code below so that it runs without errors.  Hint: you might
   need to change the names of some variables.
   ~~~~
   int main () {
       char true = 'T';
       char false = 'F';
       cout << true << " is short for true. ";
       cout << false << " is short for false." << endl;

       // Do not modify anything below.
       return 0;
   }
