   Below is one way to complete the program.  There are many creative
   ways that you could use the order of operations to come up with a complex
   expression that will bring you to ``'a'``, here is one way.

   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main () {
      char a = 's';

      // Complete the line below.
      a = a - (3 * 5 + 3);

      // Do not modify anything below.
      cout << a;
   }
