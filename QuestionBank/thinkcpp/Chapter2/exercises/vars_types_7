    What line does the first error occur in the following program?
    If there is no error, what is the output?

    .. code-block::
       :linenos:

       int main() {
         string Tom = "Tom";
         string friend = "Jerry";
         cout << tom;
         cout << "is friends with"; cout << friend;
       }

    -   line 2, a variable cannot have the same name as its value

        -   A variable can have any value... as long as the types are
            the same.

    -   line 3, you cannot have a variable named friend

        +   ``friend`` is a reserved keyword in C++ and can't be used
            as a variable name.  What a shame, since Tom and Jerry are
            the best of friends!

    -   line 5, you cannot have two statements on the same line

        -   You can have as many statements as you want on one line,
            as long as you terminate each one with a semicolon.

    -   No error, ``Tom is friends with Jerry``

        -   If the code runs, C++ doesn't automatically add spaces
            between consecutive strings.

    -   No error, ``Tomis friends withJerry``

        -   If the error was corrected, this would be the output.
            Unfortunately, there is an error that prevents this line
            from executing.
