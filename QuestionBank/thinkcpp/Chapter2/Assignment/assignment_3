   You love your car, and you decide to keep track of its make, model,
   and year.  You do so using three assignment statements IN THAT ORDER.
   Now, I don't know what car you really drive, but for the sake of this
   problem, I'm assuming that you drive a 2001 Jeep Cherokee.  Hint: there
   are a couple ways to write an assignment statement.
   -----
   string make;
   make = "Jeep";
   =====
   string make = Jeep; #paired
   =====
   make = "Jeep;" #paired
   =====
   string model = "Cherokee";
   =====
   string model; #paired
   model = Cherokee;
   =====
   string model = Cherokee; #paired
   =====
   int year = 2001;
   =====
   int year; #paired
   2001 = year;
   =====
   int year; #paired
   year = 2001
