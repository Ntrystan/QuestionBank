    What is the output of the following code block?
    
    ::
    
       int main() {
         string apples;
         apples = "bananas";
         string pineapple;
         string mango = "mango";
         pineapple = apples;
         cout << "My favorite fruit is ";
         cout << pineapple << endl;
         pineapple = mango;
       }
    
    -   ``My favorite fruit is pineapple``
    
        -   ``pineapple`` is the name of the variable, but it's not necessarily
            the value of that variable.
    
    -   ``My favorite fruit is bananas``
    
        +   ``pineapple = apples``, and ``apples = "bananas"``.
    
    -   ``My favorite fruit is apples``
    
        -   ``pineapple = apples``, but what does ``apples`` equal?
    
    -   ``My favorite fruit is mango``
    
        -   ``"mango"`` is the value of the variable ``pineapple`` at the end of
            ``main``, but not at the line of the ``cout``.
    
    -   Compile error.
    
        -   There are no syntax errors that will cause an issue compiling.
