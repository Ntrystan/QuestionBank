    What is printed when the following code is run?
    
    ::
    
        int main() {
          int x;
          int y = 2;
          int z = 4;
          x = z;
          z = 6;
          y = x + z;
          cout << y + z;
        }
    
    -   ``6``
    
        -   The variables ``y`` and ``z`` have been re-assigned.
    
    -   ``10``
    
        -   This would be correct if we had written ``cout << x + z``.
    
    -   ``16``
    
        +   Walking through each line of code and keeping track of variables,
            like you just did, is called **tracing**.
    
    -   ``yz``
    
        -   If y and z were characters ``'y'`` and ``'z'``, it would be legal to add
            them together.  But the result ``243`` might surprise you!
