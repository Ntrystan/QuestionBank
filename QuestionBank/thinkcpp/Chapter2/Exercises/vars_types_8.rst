    Your math teacher just gave an exam that had all of the students
    panicking.  Four students decide to share their scores to see who
    did the best.  At the end of the program's execution, who has the
    highest score on the exam?

       int main() {
         int Regina = 6 * (3 + 2) / 100;
         int Gretchen = (3 + 5) * 6 / 100;
         int Karen =  6 * 3 + 2 / 100;
         int Cady = (3 * 5) * 6 / 100;
       }
    
    -   Regina
    
        -   Using the order of operations we have Regina scoring 30 / 100.
    
    -   Gretchen
    
        -   Using the order of operations we have Gretchen scoring 48 / 100.
    
    -   Karen
    
        +   ``6 * 3 = 18``, and ``18 + 2 / 100 = 18`` due to integer division.
            Believe it or not, due to the order of operations and integer division,
            Karen ended up with the highest "score" at the end of the program's execution.
    
    -   Cady
    
        -   Using the order of operations we have Mathlete Cady scoring 90 / 100.
            This would be the highest score... if it weren't for integer division.
    
    -   They all got 0's.
    
        -   Integer division rounds the quotient down to the nearest integer. Take
            a closer look at what is being divided on each line, because not everyone
            recieved a zero!
