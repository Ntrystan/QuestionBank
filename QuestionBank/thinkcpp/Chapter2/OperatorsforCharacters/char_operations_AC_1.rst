   :caption: Adding to Characters

   This program performs character addition.  It works by converting
   the character 'a' to ASCII, adding 1 to this value, then converting the
   result from ASCIIs back to a character.

   int main () {
       char letter;
       letter = 'a' + 1;
       cout << letter << endl;
