   Finish the code below so that the velocity is calculated
   and returned on the same line.  Hint: the current velocity
   results from 1) the initial velocity and 2) the acceleration over
   a window of time.  Use v0 for initial velocity, a for
   acceleration, and t for time.
   ~~~~
   int velocity(int v0, int a, int t) {
       // You may only use the next line for your code.
       return ;
   }
