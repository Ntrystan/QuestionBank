   :feedback: Ideally, you want your variables to be named according to what they represent.  Not the case here!  Try again!
   :match_1: char joe;|||'x'
   :match_2: string ten;|||"Joe"
   :match_3: int x;|||10
   :pct_on_first: 0.6666666667
   :total_students_attempting: 6
   :num_students_correct: 6.0
   :mean_clicks_to_correct: 1.5

   Match the variable to the kind of value it can store.
