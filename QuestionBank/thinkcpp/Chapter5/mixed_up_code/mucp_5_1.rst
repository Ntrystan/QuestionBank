   Vacation time! But before you go, you need to convert your currency.
   Let's write the code for the ``dollarToYen`` function. ``dollarToYen``
   takes a ``double dollar`` and returns the equivalent amount of Japanese yen.
   The conversion rate is 1 USD equals 105.42 Japanese yen.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
   -----
   double dollarToYen (double dollar) {
   =====
   int dollarToYen (double dollar) {  #distractor
   =====
   void dollarToYen (double dollar) {  #distractor
   =====
   double dollarToYen () {  #distractor
   =====
      double yen;  #distractor
   =====
      return 105.42 * dollar;
   =====
      return 105.42 * yen;  #distractor
   =====
   }
