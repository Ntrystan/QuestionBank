   Suppose you have written the following functions for baking cake.
   Is there anything wrong with how ``bakeCake`` was overloaded?
   
   ::
   
       bool bakeCake (string cakeMix, int eggs, double milk, bool birthday);
       bool bakeCake (string cakeMix, int eggs, double water, bool holiday);
