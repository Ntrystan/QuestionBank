    A number is a common factor of two other numbers if it divides evenly into both of the
    other numbers. For example, 2 is a common factor of 4 and 18, because 2 goes evenly into
    4 and 18. Write the function ``isCommonFactor``, which takes three ``ints`` as parameters,
    ``num1``, ``num2``, and ``factor``. ``isCommonFactor`` returns ``true`` if ``factor`` is a
    factor of both ``num1`` and ``num2``, and returns ``false`` otherwise.

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    bool isCommonFactor (int num1, int num2, int factor) {
        // Write your implementation here.
    }

    int main() {
        cout << isCommonFactor (132, 42, 11) << endl;    // Should output 0
        cout << isCommonFactor (24, 8, 4) << endl;       // Should output 1
        cout << isCommonFactor (75, 20, 5) << endl;      // Should output 1
        cout << isCommonFactor (74, 23, 3) << endl;      // Should output 0
    }
