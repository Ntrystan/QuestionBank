    The astronomical start and end dates of the four seasons are based on the position of
    the Earth relative to the Sun. As a result, it changes every year and can be difficult to
    remember. However, the meteorological start and end dates are based on the Gregorian calendar
    and is easier to remember. Spring starts on March 1, summer starts on June 1, fall starts on
    September 1, and winter starts on December 1. Write a function called ``birthSeason``, which takes
    two ``int``\s as parameters, ``month`` and ``day``. ``birthSeason`` calculates which season
    the birthday falls in according to the meteorological start and returns a ``string`` with the correct season.
    For example, ``birthSeason (7, 5)`` returns "summer" since July 5 is in the summer.

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    string birthSeason (int month, int day) {
        // Write your implementation here.
    }

    int main() {
        cout << birthSeason (5, 3) << endl;      // Should output spring
        cout << birthSeason (7, 5) << endl;      // Should output summer
        cout << birthSeason (11, 24) << endl;    // Should output fall
        cout << birthSeason (2, 20) << endl;     // Should output winter
    }
