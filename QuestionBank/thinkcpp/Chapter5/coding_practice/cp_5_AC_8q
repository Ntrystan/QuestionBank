    In the enchanted Mushroom Forest, there are many different types of
    mushrooms as far as the eye can see. Most of these mushrooms
    can make delicious stews and dishes, but some of them are poisonous.
    Write the function ``isPoisonous``, which takes an ``char size``,
    ``int numSpots``, and ``bool isRed`` as parameters. If a mushroom is large
    ('L') and has fewer than 3 spots, it is poisonous. If a mushroom is small ('S')
    and is red, it is poisonous. If a mushroom has fewer than 3 spots or is not red,
    it is poisonous. Otherwise, it is not. ``isPoisonous`` should return ``true`` if
    the mushroom is poisonous and ``false`` otherwise.

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    bool isPoisonous (char size, int numSpots, bool isRed) {
        // Write your implementation here.
    }

    int main() {
        cout << isPoisonous ('S', 10, 0) << endl;    // Should output 1
        cout << isPoisonous ('S', 2, 1) << endl;     // Should output 1
        cout << isPoisonous ('L', 1, 1) << endl;     // Should output 1
        cout << isPoisonous ('L', 4, 1) << endl;     // Should output 0
    }
