   :answer_a: the types and quantities of variables that make up the function
   :answer_b: the process of combining one or more functions into more complicated ones
   :answer_c: the process of creating a function using incremental development
   :answer_d: all of the above
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would tell us what variables the function is composed of, but this is not what function composition means.
   :feedback_b: This is what we did inside of the fred function.
   :feedback_c: Incremental development is useful in function composition, but does not define it.
   :feedback_d: There is only one correct answer here!
