   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This function name isn't much of a change from our original, and would be a good choice, but what about the other options?
   :feedback_b: Although unconventional, there is nothing wrong about this name, but what about eat_pizza?
   :feedback_c: Although unconventional, there is nothing wrong about this name, but what about fluffy_cat?
   :feedback_d: All of these function names are technically legal, but in general, it's good practice to name your functions something that describes what they do.
   :feedback_e: There's nothing wrong with any of these function names, although some of them are weird.

   It turns out you already have a function called ``printHelloName``
   so you must rename this one.  Which of the following could be the
   new name for your function?

   ::

       void printHelloName (string name) {
         cout << "Hello " << name << "!" <<  endl;
       }
