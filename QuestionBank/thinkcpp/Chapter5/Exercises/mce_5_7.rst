    Are there any issues with the code below?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
      bool isEven (int num) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
          return true;
        }
      }
    
    - Yes, we have to return either 0 or 1.
    
      - Returning a 0 or 1 would be returning an ``int``, even though booleans evaluate to 0 or 1.
    
    - Yes, we cannot pass an ``int`` into a ``bool`` function.
    
      - The type of variables in the parameter list do not affect the return type.
    
    - Yes, there is no case for odd numbers.
    
      + Since we never established an else clause, if the input was an odd number, the function would not return anything despite not being a void function.
    
    - There are no issues with the code.
    
      - There is an issue with the code. Can you find it?
