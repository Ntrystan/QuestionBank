    If we wanted to create a boolean function called ``isPrime``, which takes an ``int input``
    as a parameter, which of the following would be the correct function header?
    
    - ``boolean isPrime (int input)``
    
      - In C++, use the ``bool`` keyword for a boolean.
    
    - ``bool isPrime (input)``
    
      - In a function header, the type of each variable must be specified in the parameter list.
    
    - ``bool isPrime (int input)``
    
      + This is the correct function header for the function.
    
    - ``int isPrime (bool input)``
    
      - Take a closer look at what the return type is.
