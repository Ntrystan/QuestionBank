    What should be the return type of the function ``convertToCelsius``?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
      ______ convertToCelsius (double fahrenheit) {
        double celsius;
        celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
        return celsius;
      }
    
    - ``int``
    
      - What variable are we returning in the function, and what is the variable's type?
    
    - ``double``
    
      + The function returns ``celsius``, which is a ``double``.
    
    - ``string``
    
      - What variable are we returning in the function, and what is the variable's type?
    
    - ``void``
    
      - Since we are returning something in the function, the function is not ``void``.
