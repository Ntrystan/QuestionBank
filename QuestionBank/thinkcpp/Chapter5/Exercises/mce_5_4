    If we wrote the following function, which of the other functions below can we also legally write
    and add to the program?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
      int func (double x, bool y);
    
    - int func (double a, bool b);
    
      - Since this function has the same name and parameter types as the given function, it is not allowed.
    
    - int foo (double x, bool y);
    
      + This function has a different name from the given function, so it is allowed.
    
    - int func (double x);
    
      + Although this function has the same name as the given function, it has a different number of parameters, so it is allowed.
    
    - void func (double x, bool y);
    
      - Although this function has a different return type, its parameter list is the same as the given function, so it is not allowed.
    
    - int func (bool y, double x);
    
      + Although this function has the same name as the given function, its parameter list is in a different order, so it is allowed.
