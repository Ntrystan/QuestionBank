   :answer_a: combining the parameters
   :answer_b: printing out the parameters
   :answer_c: returning something
   :answer_d: debugging
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Unless the function requires you to do so, then this is unnecessary.
   :feedback_b: If you don't know the values of the parameters, this could be useful, but there is a better answer.
   :feedback_c: This is called placekeeping.  You don't have to return the correct answer, but you do need to return the correct data type.
   :feedback_d: You don't need to debug until after you've written the function.

   When writing the implementation for a function, a good place to
   start is __________.
