   ``buildEuchreDeck()`` returns the deck of Euchre cards defined on the previous page.
   If we run the following code, what is returned?

   ::

     int main() {
        EuchreDeck = buildEuchreDeck()
        Card card (3, 6);
        find(card, EuchreDeck)
      }

   |blank|.

   - :-1: Correct! The find method should return -1 if the card is not part of the deck.
     :x: Incorrect! Hint: take a look at the suit and rank of card.
