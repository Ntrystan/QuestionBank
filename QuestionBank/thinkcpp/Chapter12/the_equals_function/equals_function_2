   :answer_a: A free-standing function, because we shouldn't "invoke" the function on just one Card.
   :answer_b: A member function, because the equals() operation is part of the Card data structure.
   :answer_c: Does not matter!
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! We can invoke the function on a Card!
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! The equals() operation is not necessarily part of the Card data structure.
   :feedback_c: Correct! This is a matter of preference!

   Should we write the equals() function as a free-standing function, or as a member function of ``Card``?
