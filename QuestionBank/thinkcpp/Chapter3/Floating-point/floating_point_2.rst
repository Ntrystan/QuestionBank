   It's your birthday and your cake can serve 12.  You want to slice it
   evenly so that you and each of your 4 friends receive an equal amount.
   One of your friends is on a diet and, and wants to know the serving size
   of her slice.  You write the following code in C++ to answer her question.
   
   ::
   
       int servings = 12;
       int people = 5;
   
       double servingSize = servings / people;
   
   Based on the value of ``servingSize``, you tell your friend that each
   slice is |blank| servings.  This is |blank| (more, less, the same) than/as
   the actual serving size of her slice.
   
   - :2: Correct! C++ performs integer division.
     :.*: servingSize and people are integer variables!
   - :[Ll][Ee][Ss][Ss]: Correct! You just unintentionally messed up your friend's diet.
     :[Mm][Oo][Rr][Ee]: Remember, integer division rounds down to the nearest integer.
     :.*: Remember, C++ performs integer division.
