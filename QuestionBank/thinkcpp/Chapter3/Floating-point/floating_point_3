   Suppose it's your birthday and your friend bought you a cake that
   can serve 12.  You want to slice your cake so that each of your 5
   friends recieves an equal amount of cake.  Some of your friends are
   on a diet, and want to know the serving size of their slice.  You
   write the following code in C++ to answer their question.

   ::

       int servings = 12;
       int people = 5;

       double servingSize = apples / people;

   After execution, what is the value of servingSize? |blank|

   - :2: Correct! This isn't the information you wanted to calculate, but since C++ performs integer division, it's technically what you asked it to calculate.
     :.*: Don't forget that slice and people are integer variables!
