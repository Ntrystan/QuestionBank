    Which of the following is a correct function header (first line of
    a function definition)?
    
    -   ``void printName()``
    
        -   This function header is missing a ``{``, which is needed to begin defining the function.
    
    -   ``totalCostAfterTax () {``
    
        -   This function header is missing a return type.
    
    -   ``void todaysWeather () {``
    
        +   Correct!
    
    -   ``void finalGrade {``
    
        -   This function header is missing parentheses. Even if a function does not take in any parameters, empty parentheses should be used.
