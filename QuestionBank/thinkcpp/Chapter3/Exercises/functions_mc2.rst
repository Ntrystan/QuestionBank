    What is the value of x after the program executes?
    
    ::
    
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
    
        int main() {
          int x = acos(-1);
        }
    
    -   3.14159265358979323846
    
        -   If ``x`` were a double, C++ would automatically round the value
            of pi to **15** decimal places.

        -   Automatic type conversion will round the value of pi down to the
            nearest integer, but what else happens when we convert a ``double``
            to an ``int``?
    
    -   3
    
        -   The value of x *should* be 3, since automatic type conversion will
            round the value of pi down to the nearest integer.
    
    -   Error!
    
        +   Whenever we use math functions, we must include the ``<cmath>`` header file.
