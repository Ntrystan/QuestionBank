    **Multiple Response** Which of the following would work as a function header
    (first line of a function).
    
    -   ``printHelloWorld () {``
    
        -   This function header is missing a type.
    
    -   ``string palindrome (word) {``
    
        -   The function's parameter is missing a type.
    
    -   ``int mult (int a, int b) {``
    
        +   Correct!
    
    -   ``char shiftThree (char letter)``
    
        -   This function header is missing a squiggly bracket ``{``.
    
    -   ``void giveCompliment () {``
    
        +   Correct!
    
    -   ``string friend (string name) {``
    
        -   ``friend`` is a reserved keyword in C++.
