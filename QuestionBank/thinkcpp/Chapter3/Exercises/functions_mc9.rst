    What is printed when the following code runs?  Are there any errors?
    
    ::
    
        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
    
        void printWord (string w) {
            cout << w << w;
        }
    
        int main () {
            char a = 'a' + 5;
            printWord (a);
        }
    
    -   ``a``
    
        -   Is ``a`` still the value of a?  Does the function print only
            the word only once?
    
    -   ``f``
    
        -   Does the function print only the word only once?
    
    -   ``aa``
    
        -   Is ``a`` still the value of a?
    
    -   ``ff``
    
        -   Is ``char`` the proper variable type to pass as an argument?
    
    
    -   Error!
    
        +   ``printWord`` takes a string, not a character, as an argument.
