   Finish the code below so that it calculates the log of ``a``
   minus the *natural* log of ``a`` and prints the difference.
   You will need to use cmath functions.

   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void logSubtraction (int a) {
       difference = ;
       cout << difference;
   }
