   :caption: Working with Angles

   This program also uses built-in functions from the cmath library,
   specifically the functions that deal with angles.  As you can see,
   we have a line of code that converts the default radians value to
   degrees.

   #include <iostream>
   #include <cmath>
   using namespace std;

   int main () {
       double pi = acos(-1.0);
       double degrees = 90;
       double angle = degrees * 2 * pi / 360.0;
       cout << pi << endl;
       cout << degrees << endl;
       cout << angle << endl;
       return 0;
   }
