   What are the units used by sinusoidal functions (sin, asin, e.t.c.) in C++?

   - :[Rr][Aa][Dd][Ii][Aa][Nn][Ss]?: If you need to convert to degrees, just multiply by 360 and divide by 2:math:`\pi`.
     :[Dd][Ee][Gg][Rr][Ee][Ee][Ss]?: This is a unit sometimes used for sinusoidal functions, but not the one used by C++.
