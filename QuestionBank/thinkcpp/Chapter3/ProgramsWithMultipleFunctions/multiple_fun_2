   :feedback_a: Keep in mind that one of the functions is being called three times.
   :feedback_b: Execution begins in the main, then functions are executed as they are called.
   :feedback_c: Keep in mind that one of the functions is being called three times.  Also, note that function execution begins in int main.
   :feedback_d: Keep in mind that execution begins in the main.  Remember to follow the order of execution, which is not necessarily the order the program is written.
   :feedback_e: Keep in mind that execution begins in the main.

   Consider the following C++ code. Note that line numbers are included
   on the left.

   .. code-block:: cpp
      :linenos:

      #include <iostream>
      using namespace std;

      void newLine () {
        cout << endl;
      }

      void threeLine () {
        newLine ();  newLine ();  newLine ();
      }

      int main () {
        cout << "First Line." << endl;
        threeLine ();
        cout << "Second Line." << endl;
        return 0;
      }

   Which of the following reflects the order in which these lines
   of code are executed in C++?
