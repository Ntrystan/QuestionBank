    Which of these statements has proper syntax?
    
    -   ``double x = log6 (12);``
    
        -   ``log6`` is not a built in cmath function, but you could write an implementation for it if you wanted!
    
    -   ``double val = abs (tan (1.57));``
    
        +   This correctly uses cmath functions!
    
    -   ``double num = exp (cosine (0.86667));``
    
        -   ``cosine`` is not a built in cmath function, but ``cos`` is!
    
    -   ``double y = exp (cos (1.047)) + exp (tan (2.094))``
    
        -   This would be correct if it ended in a semi-colon.
