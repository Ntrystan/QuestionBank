    Which of the following is a correct function header (first line of
    a function definition)?
    
    -   ``totalcost (double cost, tax, discount)``
    
        -   ``totalcost`` needs a return type, and each parameter needs a data type.
    
    -   ``totalCost (double cost, double tax) {``
    
        -   ``totalcost`` needs a return type.
    
    -   ``void totalCost (double cost, double tax, double discount) {``
    
        +   Correct!
    
    -   ``void totalCost (double cost, double tax)``
    
        -   This function header is missing a ``{``, which is needed to begin defining the function.
