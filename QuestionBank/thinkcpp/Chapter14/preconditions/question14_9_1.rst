   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: Assume assumptions are always true.
   :answer_b: Only check the preconditions.
   :answer_c: Document assumptions explicitly as part of the program.
   :answer_d: Write code that checks assumptions, like using assert statements.
   :correct: c,d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! Assumptions can turn out to be true or false.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! In order to maintain invariance, we must ensure that postconditions are met as well.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: Correct!

   Which of the following are ways that we can make our code more robust?
