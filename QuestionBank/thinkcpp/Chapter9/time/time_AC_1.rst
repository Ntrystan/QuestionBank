  The active code below shows what the structure definition looks like.
  We can create a ``Time`` object in the usual way.
  ~~~~
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  struct Time {
      int hour, minute;
      double second;
  };

  int main() {
      Time time = { 11, 59, 3.14159 };
      cout << time.hour << ":" << time.minute << ":" << time.second;
  }
