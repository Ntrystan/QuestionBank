    :match_1: passing by value|||the calling function and the callee are appropriately encapsulatedâ€”it is not possible for a change in one to affect the other, except by affecting the return value.
    :match_2: passing by reference|||more efficient, because it avoids copying the argument

    Match the action to a benefit of its use.
