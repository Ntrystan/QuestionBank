   :answer_a: Because we only need the half of the dataset contained by the triangle.
   :answer_b: Because triangles are the most effective shape to use when presenting data to others.
   :answer_c: Because matrices are triangles.
   :answer_d: Because the triangle contains the entire dataset.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! All of the data above the 0 diagonal is a mirror image of the triangle! So, the triangle contains the whole dataset.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! Triangles do look cool, but they aren't necessarily the most effective shape to use when presenting data.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! This triangle is PART OF an apmatrix.
   :feedback_d: Correct! The triangle contains all data points with no repeat data. If we included all datapoints, the would just be repeats of the points we already have.

   Why aren't we filling in every value in our table, who are we leaving blank space above the diagonal of 0's?
