   :answer_a: When we initialize a new object, the compiler automatically finds the correct constructor to use.
   :answer_b: You can always initialize an object using squiggly-braces.
   :answer_c: You can have many constructors with the same name.
   :answer_d: Once you define a constructor for a structure, you MUST use it to initialize any new structures of that type.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect! This statement is true!
   :feedback_b: Correct! Once you define a constructor, you can no longer use squiggly-braces to initialize an object.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! This statement is true, as long as the constructors take different parameters.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! This statement is true!

   Which statement is **false** about constructors?
