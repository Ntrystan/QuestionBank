   :multiple_answers: 
   :answer_a: The main marks the spot in the program where execution begins.
   :answer_b: There is a limit the number of statements you can put in the main because they occupy system memory.
   :answer_c: Inside the main, program execution happens in order from top to bottom.
   :answer_d: The main program is enclosed by parentheses.
   :answer_e: The end of each statement is marked with a semicolon ( ; ).
   :correct: a,c,e
   :feedback_a: The main indicates where the program begins executing!
   :feedback_b: There is no limit to the number of statements you can put in the main, but it is good practice to keep it as short as possible.
   :feedback_c: When the program runs, it starts by executing the first statement in main, and it continues until the last.
   :feedback_d: The main program and all functions in C++ are enclosed by squiggly brackets ( { and } ).
   :feedback_e: Forgetting a semicolon will cause a compile error!
