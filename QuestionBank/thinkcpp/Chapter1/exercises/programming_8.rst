    **Multiple Response** Which of the following is true about writing a program.

    -   The compiler ignores anything after ``//``.

        +   This is called a comment, which you can use to describe your code to
            outsiders who might not understand.

    -   There is no limit the number of statements you can put in ``main``.

        +   You can include as many statments as you want to, but it is good
            practice to keep the main as short as possible.

    -   Program execution begins at the first line of code.

        -   Program execution actually begins with ``main`` and then
            happens in order, from top to bottom.

    -   ``main`` is enclosed by squiggly brackets ``{ }``.

        +   The ``main`` program and *all* functions in C++ are enclosed by squiggly brackets.

    -   The end of each statement is marked with a colon ``:``.

        -   Actually, each statement is terminated with a *semi* colon ``;``.
