    **Multiple Response**  What are the basic functions that appear in
    every programming language?
    
    -   math operations
    
        +   This is how your program can carry out complex calculations!
    
    -   debugging
    
        -   Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors AFTER you
            have written your program. It's not one of the basic functions
            of a programming language.
    
    -   input/output from the terminal and saved files
    
        +   This allows your program to communicate with data either from the user,
            or from the user's saved files.
    
    -   testing for conditions
    
        +   This is why you would consider using conditional statements
            in your program.
    
    -   repetition
    
        +   This is why you would consider using a loop in your program.
