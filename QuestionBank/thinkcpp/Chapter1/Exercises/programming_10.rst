    You were asked to parse through your program, what should this entail?
    
    -   You should walk through your program line by line to make sure it's
        that your code doing what it is supposed to.
    
        -   This is how you would detect a semantic error. Parsing doesn't involve
            semantic errors.
    
    -   You should search through your program for syntax errors.
    
        +   Parsing involves looking at the syntactic structure of your program.
    
    -   You should translate your program to object code.
    
        -   This would be quite a chore! Luckily you have an interpreter or a compiler
            to do that for you!
    
    -   You should run your program and check for run-time errors.
    
        -   Parsing doesn't involve run-time errors.
