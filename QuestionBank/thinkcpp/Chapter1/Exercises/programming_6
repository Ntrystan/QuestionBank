    What type of error would the following generate?  Assume you are
    trying to calculate the volume of a cylinder:
    
    ::
    
        int radius = 7;
        int height = 8
        double volume = 3.14 * r * r * height;
    
    -   syntax error
    
        +   You are missing a semicolon on the second line, and you are using
            the variable ``r`` without defining it on the third line.  your
            program will not compile.
    
    -   run-time error
    
        -   There are no errors that will surface at runtime.
    
    -   semantic error
    
        -   Everything looks good with your volume calculations.
    
    -   no error
    
        -   Take a closer look at the structure of the code.
