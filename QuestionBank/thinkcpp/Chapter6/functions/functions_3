   :answer_a: Once you write and debug a function, you can reuse it.
   :answer_b: Makes your program easier to read and debug.

   :answer_d: None of the above.
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: The reusability of functions is very useful.
   :feedback_b: By abstracting blocks of code, functions make your code easier to read and understand.
   :feedback_c: Recursive functions and iterative functions are useful.
   :feedback_d: All of the choices above are reasons for why functions are useful.

   What is of these is NOT a reason that functions are useful?
