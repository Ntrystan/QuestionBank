    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int loopFive (int n) {
       while (n % 5 != 0) {
         n = n + 3;
       }
       return n;
     }

     int main() {
       cout << loopFive (2);
       cout << loopFive (3);
       cout << loopFive (4);
     }

      + ``n`` is repeatedly incremented by 3 until it is divisible by 5, and this happens when ``n`` is 5, 15, and 10 for the inputs of 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
