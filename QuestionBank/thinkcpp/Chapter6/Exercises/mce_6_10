    After making some changes to his code, RePete tries again.
    This time, however, the robots don't repeat anything!
    Can you find the new error?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     void repeatBot (string input) {
       int n = 0;
       while (n > 5) {
         cout << input << " ";
         n++;
       }
     }

     int main() {
       repeatBot ("Hello, how may I help you?");
     }

    - ``n > 5`` is not a valid conditional, so the ``while`` loop doesn't execute.

      - ``n > 5`` is a boolean statement and thus is a valid conditional.

    - The value of ``n`` never gets modified in the ``while`` loop.

      - ``n`` is incremented in the ``while`` loop after the ``cout`` statement.

    - In the ``cout`` statement, only spaces are printed.

      - ``input`` is also printed.

    - Since ``n`` is declared to be 0, 0 is not greater than 5, so the ``while`` loop does not execute.

      + The ``while`` loop is ignored, and thus nothing is printed.
