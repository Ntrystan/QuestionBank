    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       int x = 0;
       int i = 1;
       while (i < 10) {
         x = i;
         i++;
       }
       cout << x;
     }

    - 0

      - ``x`` is initialized to 0, but it's value is reassigned in the while loop. Can you figure out what the final value assigned to ``x`` is?

    - 1

      - When ``i`` is 1, ``x`` is assigned the value of ``i``, so ``x`` is 1. However, the while loop continuously increments i, so the final value of ``x`` is not 1.

    - 9

      + ``x`` is assigned the value of 9 during the last iteration of the while loop, and thus 9 is the output of the program.

    - 10

      - ``i`` is incremented to a value of 10, but since ``i < 10`` is false, the contents of the while loop is not executed, so ``x`` is never assigned the value of 10.
