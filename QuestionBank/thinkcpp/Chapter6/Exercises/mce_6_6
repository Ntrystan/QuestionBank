    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       int x = 1;
       while (x < 6) {
         cout << x << "\t" << pow (x, 5) / pow (x, 3) << endl;
         x++;
       }
     }

    - The first six perfect fifths.

      - Take a closer look at the while loop and what ``x`` was initialized to.

    - The first six perfect squares.

      - Take a closer look at the while loop and what ``x`` was initialized to.

    - The first five perfect squares.

      + Dividing ``x`` to the power of 5 by ``x`` to the power of 3 effectively results in perfect squares.

    - The first five perfect cubes.

      - Take a closer look at the mathematical expression inside the while loop.
