    How many times does the following while loop run?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
     int main() {
       int i = 6;
       while (i > 2) {
         x = x + 4;
         if (x > 8) {
           x = x - 5;
       }
     }
    
    - 1
    
      - Take a closer look at the while loop and conditional.
    
    - 3
    
      - Take a closer look at the while loop and conditional.
    
    - 5
    
      - Take a closer look at the while loop and conditional.
    
    - The loop will run infinitely.
    
      + The value of ``i`` will always be greater than 2, resulting in an infinite loop.
