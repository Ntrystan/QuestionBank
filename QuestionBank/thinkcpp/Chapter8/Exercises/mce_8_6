    What is the value of ``s.coffeeCupFull`` when the code is done running?

    .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Student {
        string name;
        bool isSleepy;
        bool coffeeCupFull;
      };

      void pourCoffee (Student s) {
        s.coffeeCupFull = true;
      }

      int main() {
        Student s = { "Thor Odinson", true, false };
        if (s.isSleepy) {
          pourCoffee (s);
        }
      }

    - true

      - C++ outputs boolean values as either a 0 or 1.

    - false

      - C++ outputs boolean values as either a 0 or 1.

    - 1

      - Take a closer look at the function definition of ``pourCoffee``.

    - 0

      + Since we pass a ``Student`` object by value to ``pourCoffee``, the function makes a copy of the object and does not modify the original.
