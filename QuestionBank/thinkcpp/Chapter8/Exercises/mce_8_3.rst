    How do we assign the value of 4 to the instance variable ``numLegs`` of the ``Dog`` object?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
      struct Dog {
        string name;
        int numLegs;
        bool isPanting;
      };
    
      int main() {
        Dog doug = { "Doug", 0, true };
      }
    
    - ``Dog.numLegs = 4;``
    
      - The ``Dog`` object is ``doug``. We can use the dot notation on an object.
    
    - ``doug.legs = 4;``
    
      - Check the name of the instance variable in the ``struct`` definition.
    
    - ``doug[legs] = 4;``
    
      - We can assign values to the instance variables of a ``struct`` using dot notation.
    
    - ``doug.numLegs = 4;``
    
      + Using dot notation on ``doug``, we can set the value of ``numLegs`` to 4.
