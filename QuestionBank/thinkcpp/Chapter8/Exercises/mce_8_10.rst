    .. code-block:: cpp
    
      int main() {
        char name;
        cin >> name;
        cout << "Hello, " << name << "!";
      }
    
    - Hello, CPO!
    
      - ``cin`` reads the first ``char`` in from user input.
    
    - Hello, C!
    
      + Since 'C' is the first ``char`` in the input, this is the correct output.
    
    - Hello, C-3PO!
    
      - Check the data type of ``name``.
    
    - Error, we cannot read a character from user input.
    
      - We can read characters from user input.
