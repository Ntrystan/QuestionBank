    If the user inputted the string "R2-D2", what is the output of the code below?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
      int main() {
        string name;
        cin >> name;
        cout << "Hello, " << name << "!";
      }
    
    - R2-D2
    
      - Take another look at the ``cout`` statement.
    
    - Hello name!
    
      - ``name`` is not in quotes so the value stored in ``name`` will be printed.
    
    - Hello, R2-D2!
    
      + "R2-D2" is stored in ``name`` and is then outputted in the ``cout`` statement.
    
    - name
    
      - ``cin`` reads input from the user.
