   :answer_a: int y = circle.x();
   :answer_b: int circle = x.y;
   :answer_c: int y = circle.x;
   :answer_d: int x = circle.y;
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: No parentheses are needed.
   :feedback_b: You should be assigning to the local variable x.
   :feedback_c: You should be assigning to the local variable x.
   :feedback_d: This is the correct way to assign the value of y to x.

   You want to go to the object named ``circle`` and get the value of ``y``, then assign it to the local variable ``x``. How would you do that?
