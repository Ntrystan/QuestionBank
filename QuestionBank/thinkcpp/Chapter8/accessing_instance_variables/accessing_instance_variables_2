   .. code-block:: cpp

      struct Blue {
        double x, y;
      };

      int main() {
        Blue blank;
        blank.x = 7.0;
        blank.y = 2.0;
        cout << blank.y << blank.x;
        double distance = blank.x * blank.x + blank.y * blank.y;
        cout << distance << endl;
      }
