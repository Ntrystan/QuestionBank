   Let's write the code for the ``struct`` definition of ``Song``.
   The ``Song`` structure will have the instance variables ``string title``,
   ``string artist``, ``string album``, and ``int year`` in that order.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
   -----
   struct Song {
   =====
   struct song {  #distractor
   =====
   struct Song (  #distractor
   =====
      string title;
   =====
      string artist;
   =====
      string album;
   =====
      int year;
   =====
      string year;  #distractor
   =====
   };
   =====
   } #distractor
   =====
   ) #distractor
