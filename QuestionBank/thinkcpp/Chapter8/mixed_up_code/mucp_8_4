   Let's write the code for the ``struct`` definition of ``Unicorn``.
   The ``Unicorn`` structure will have the instance variables ``string name``,
   ``int age``, ``double hornLength``, ``string hairColor``,
   and ``bool isSparkly`` in that order.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.

   struct Unicorn {
