   Let's write the code for the ``convertToHumanAge`` function. ``convertToHumanAge``
   takes a ``Unicorn`` as a parameter and returns the equivalent human age.
   If a unicorn is sparkly, then its equivalent human age is three times its age in unicorn years
   plus the length of its horn. If a unicorn is not sparkly, then its equivalent human age is
   four times its age in unicorn years plus twice the length of its horn.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.

   int convertToHumanAge (Unicorn u) {
   =====
   void convertToHumanAge (Unicorn u) {  #paired
   =====
      if (u.isSparkly) {
   =====
      if (isSparkly) {  #paired
   =====
         return 3 * u.age + u.hornLength;
      }
   =====
         return 3 * age + hornLength;  #paired
      }
   =====
      else {
   =====
         return 4 * u.age + 2 * u.hornLength;
      }
   =====
      int humanYears;  #distractor

   }
