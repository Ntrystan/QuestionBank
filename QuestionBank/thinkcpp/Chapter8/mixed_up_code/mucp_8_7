   Let's write the code for the ``struct`` definitions of ``Address`` and ``Employee``.
   The ``Address`` structure will have the instance variables ``int houseNumber``,
   ``string state`` (abbreviation), and ``int postalAddress`` in that order. The ``Employee``
   structure will be a nested structure with the instance variables ``string name``,
   ``int id``, ``double salary``, and ``Address address`` in that order.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order, with ``Address`` defined before ``Employee``.
