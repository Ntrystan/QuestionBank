   Let's write the code for the ``storeEmployeeData`` function. ``storeEmployeeData`` doesn't
   take any parameters and prompts the user for information regarding their
   name, id, salary, and address in that order. It then returns an Employee object with
   the stored data. Declare all variables before prompting the user.
   Put the necessary blocks of code in the correct order.
