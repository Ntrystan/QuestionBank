   :answer_c: -4 -3 -2 -1 0
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Notice that x is negative.
   :feedback_b: Notice that the value of x is incremented before it is printed.
   :feedback_c: The value of x is incremented before it is printed so the first value printed is -4.


   What does the following code print?

   .. code-block:: cpp
      :linenos:

      int x = -5;
      while (x < 0) {
        x = x + 1;
        cout << x << " ";
      }
