   The program below should print out the index of the second instance of the
   character 'i' but the code is mixed up and contains extra blocks.
   Put the necessary blocks in the correct order.

   int main() {
   =====
      string quote = "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.";
   =====
      int i = 0;  #distractor
   =====
      while (i < quote.length()) {  #distractor
   =====
      int first = quote.find("i");
   =====
      int index = find (quote, 'i', first + 1);
   =====
      int index = find (quote, 'i', first);  #paired
   =====
      cout << index;
   }
   =====
      cout << first;  #paired
   }
