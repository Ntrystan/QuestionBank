  :caption: Creating a string variable

  In the active code below, the first line creates a ``string`` without
  giving it a value. The second line assigns it the string value ``"Hello,"``.
  The third line is a combined declaration and assignment, also called an initialization.

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main() {
      string first;
      first = "Hello, ";
      string second = "world.";
  }
