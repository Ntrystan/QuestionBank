   :answer_c: C++rocks
   :answer_d: Error, you cannot add two strings together.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Concatenation does not automatically add a space.
   :feedback_b: The expression s+t is evaluated first, then the resulting string is printed.
   :feedback_c: Yes, the two strings are glued end to end.
   :feedback_d: The + operator has different meanings depending on the operands, in this case, two strings.


   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: cpp

      string s = "C++";
      string t = "rocks";
      cout << s + t << endl;
