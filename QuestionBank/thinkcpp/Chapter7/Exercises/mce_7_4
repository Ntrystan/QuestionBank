    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       string quote = "Look at me. I'm the captain now.";
       int x = quote.length();
       cout << quote[x];
     }

    - -1

      - -1 is not in ``quote``.

    - w

      - ``x`` is not the index value of the character 'w'.

    - .

      - ``x`` is not the index value of the last period.

    - Error, we are indexing out of bounds.

      + ``x`` has a value of 32 and there is no index 32 in ``quote``.
