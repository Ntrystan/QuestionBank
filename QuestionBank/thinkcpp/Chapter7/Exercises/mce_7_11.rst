    An error occured while delivering a message. All instances of the letter 's'
    got replaced by 'X's. Can you complete the code below to fix this error by selecting
    the correct line of code to replace the question marks?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
     int main() {
       string question = "Honey? Where'X my Xuper Xuit?";
       int i = 0;
       while (i < question.length()) {
         if (question[i] == 'X') {
           ?????
         }
         i++;
       }
       cout << question;
     }
    
    - ``question['X'] = 's';``
    
      - The argument in the ``[]`` operator should be a position in the string.
    
    - ``'s' = question[i];``
    
      - Check the order of your assignment.
    
    - ``'X' = 's';``
    
      - We cannot assign the value of 's' to 'X'.
    
    - ``question[i] = 's';``
    
      + This will successfully replace all instances of 'X' with 's'.
