    What is the output of the code below?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
     int main() {
       string quote = "I love you 3000.";
       int x = 3;
       int y = 3 * x;
       int z = 1;
       if (y > 12) {
         z = z + x + y;
       }
       else {
         z = z + y - x;
       }
       cout << quote[z];
     }
    
    - I
    
      - In order to access the character 'I', ``z`` would have to be 0.
    
    - 0
    
      - What is the value of ``z``?
    
    - o
    
      - The value of ``z`` is not 3.
    
    - y
    
      + The final value of ``z`` is 7, and 'y' is at index 7 of ``quote``.
