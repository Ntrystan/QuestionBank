    What is the output of the code below?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
     int main() {
       string quote = "Look at me. I'm the captain now.";
       int x = quote.length();
       cout << quote[x];
     }
    
    - -1
    
      - -1 is not in ``quote``.
    
    - w
    
      - ``x`` is not the index value of the character 'w'.
    
    - .
    
      - ``x`` is not the index value of the last period.
    
    - Error, we are indexing out of bounds.
    
      + ``x`` has a value of 32 and there is no index 32 in ``quote``.
