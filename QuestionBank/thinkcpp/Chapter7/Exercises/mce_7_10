    What is the output of the code below?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
     int main() {
       string call = "Marco!";
       string response = "Polo!";
       string output = "call" + "response";
       cout << output;
     }
    
    - Marco! Polo!
    
      - Take a closer look at the initialization of ``output``.
    
    - Marco!Polo!
    
      - Take a closer look at the initialization of ``output``.
    
    - call response
    
      - Can we concatenate "call" and "response"?
    
    - callresponse
    
      - Can we concatenate "call" and "response"?
    
    - Error, we cannot concatenate native C strings.
    
      + We cannot concatenate "call" and "response", so this code results in an error.
