    .. code-block:: cpp
    
     int main() {
       string tongue_twister = "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?";
       int index = quote.find("wood");
       cout << index;
     }
    
    - 9
    
      + The index of 'w' in the first "wood" is at index 9.
    
    - 10
    
      - Remember indexing begins at 0 in C++.
