    What is the output of the code below?
    
    .. code-block:: cpp
    
     int main() {
       string quote = "Why so serious?";
       int index = quote.find("a");
       cout << index;
     }
    
    - -1
    
      + Since 'a' is not found in ``quote``, the ``find`` function returns -1.
    
    - 0
    
      - 'a' is not the first character in ``quote``.
    
    - 8
    
      - The character at index 8 is 'e'.
    
    - 15
    
      - There is no index ``15`` in quote.
