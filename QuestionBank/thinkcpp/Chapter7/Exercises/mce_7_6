    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       string quote = "Why so serious?";
       int index = quote.find("a");
       cout << index;
     }

    - -1

      + Since 'a' is not found in ``quote``, the ``find`` function returns -1.

    - 0

      - 'a' is not the first character in ``quote``.

    - 8

      - The character at index 8 is 'e'.

    - 15

      - There is no index ``15`` in quote.
