    What is the output of the code below?

    .. code-block:: cpp

     int main() {
       string tongue_twister = "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?";
       int index = quote.find("wood");
       cout << index;
     }

    - 9

      + The index of 'w' in the first "wood" is at index 9.

    - 10

      - Remember indexing begins at 0 in C++.

    - 12

      - The ``find`` function returns the index of the first character of the found string.

    - 22

      - The ``find`` function returns the index of the first instance of the input.
