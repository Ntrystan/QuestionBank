    What is true about the pivot in quicksort?    
    

    - Before partitioning, it is always the smallest element in the list    
      

      - As the pivot will be to the right of all smaller elements and to the left of    
        all larger elements, it is in the same position it will be when the array is    
        sorted.
    - After partitioning, the pivot will always be in the centre of the list    
      

      - As the pivot will be to the right of all smaller elements and to the left of    
        all larger elements, it is in the same position it will be when the array is    
        sorted.
    - After partitioning, the pivot will never move again    
      

      + Correct!
    - A random choice of pivot is always the optimal choice, regardless of input    
      

      - As the pivot will be to the right of all smaller elements and to the left of    
        all larger elements, it is in the same position it will be when the array is    
        sorted.
