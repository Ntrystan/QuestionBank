    Richard has the following struct:    
        
    ``struct node{``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
               int val;    
               struct node *next;    
           };    
        
    And he creates a node:\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    ``struct node **ptr = &( malloc(sizeof(struct node)) );``    
        
    Which of the following will NOT set ptr's associated val to 6?    
    

    - (***ptr).val = 6    
      

      + Correct!
    - (**ptr).val = 6    
      

      - ***ptr is not useful here
    - (*ptr)->val = 6    
      

      - ***ptr is not useful here
