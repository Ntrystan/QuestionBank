    Which option is NOT an alternative solution for the bug that exists in this    
    code?    
        
    class shape{    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
           float area;    
        
           public shape( float a){    
        
                 area = a;    
        
           }    
        
        
    }    
        
    class square extends shape{    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
            float side;    
        
            public square (float s){    
        
                      side = s;    
        
           }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - *square* constructor should call a super constructor explicitly.    
      

      - class _square_ should have a null constructor.
    - Class *shape* must have a null constructor.    
      

      - class _square_ should have a null constructor.
    - class *square* should have a null constructor.    
      

      + Correct!
    - shape constructor should be removed.    
      

      - class _square_ should have a null constructor.
