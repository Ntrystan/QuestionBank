    Which of the following assertions about the effect of ``int(my_var)`` is    
    correct?    
    

    - It modifies the value of ``my_var``\ , truncating it to make it an integer.    
      

      - A is wrong because the int() function does not modify (mutate) its parameter    
            
        B is wrong because the int() function does not return a Boolean, it returns an    
        int()    
            
        C is wrong because the int() function works with double/float inputs, which    
        are not ints (although it will generate an error if invoked with a String, for    
        example)    
            
        D is correct!  int() converts ints and doubles to an int, truncating any extra    
        information (i.e. the decimal portion of a double), and will generate an error    
        if called with a non-numeric value
    - It returns ``True``\ if ``my_var`` is an integer; and ``False``\ , otherwise.    
      

      - A is wrong because the int() function does not modify (mutate) its parameter    
            
        B is wrong because the int() function does not return a Boolean, it returns an    
        int()

        information (i.e. the decimal portion of a double), and will generate an error    
        if called with a non-numeric value
    - It produces an error if ``my_var``\ is not an integer.

        information (i.e. the decimal portion of a double), and will generate an error    
        if called with a non-numeric value
    - It returns the integer representation of the value associated with ``my_var``\ ,    
      or an error    
      

      + Correct!
    - None of the above
