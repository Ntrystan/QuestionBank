    Growing the array used to implement a heap so that it may hold more elements    
    is    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - The order of elements in the array doesn't change any. They only need to be    
        copied over in their original sequence, making this an O(N) operation.
    - O(log N)    
      

      - The order of elements in the array doesn't change any. They only need to be    
        copied over in their original sequence, making this an O(N) operation.
    - O(N)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(N log N)    
      

      - The order of elements in the array doesn't change any. They only need to be    
        copied over in their original sequence, making this an O(N) operation.
    - O(N2)    
      

      - The order of elements in the array doesn't change any. They only need to be    
        copied over in their original sequence, making this an O(N) operation.
