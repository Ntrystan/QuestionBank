    Suppose ``s`` is an instance of a stack that can store Strings, and I execute    
    the following statements?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           1. s.push("Finland");    
           2. s.push("is");    
           3. s.push("my");    
           4. String w = s.peek();    
           5. String x = s.pop();    
           6. s.push("home");    
           7. String y = s.pop();    
           8. String z = s.pop();    
        
    What is the value of z after executing these statements in order?    
    

    - "Finland"    
      

      - After the three pushes the stack contents (from top) is ["my" "is" "Finland"    
        ...]    
            
        4\. doesn't change the stack.    
            
        the contents of the stack are (after each numbered instruction)    
            
        5\. ["is" "Finland" ...]    
            
        6\. ["home" "is" "Finland" ...]    
            
        7\. ["is" "Finland" ...]    
            
        8\. sets z to "is", which is popped, leaving the stack as ["Finland" ...]    
            
        So B is correct.
    - "is"    
      

      + Correct!
    - "my"    
      

      - After the three pushes the stack contents (from top) is ["my" "is" "Finland"    
        ...]    
            
        4\. doesn't change the stack.    
            
        the contents of the stack are (after each numbered instruction)    
            
        5\. ["is" "Finland" ...]    
            
        6\. ["home" "is" "Finland" ...]    
            
        7\. ["is" "Finland" ...]    
            
        8\. sets z to "is", which is popped, leaving the stack as ["Finland" ...]    
            
        So B is correct.
    - "home"    
      

      - After the three pushes the stack contents (from top) is ["my" "is" "Finland"

        6\. ["home" "is" "Finland" ...]    
            
        7\. ["is" "Finland" ...]    
            
        8\. sets z to "is", which is popped, leaving the stack as ["Finland" ...]    
            
        So B is correct.
    - None of the above
