    Consider the incomplete code segment below. The segment is supposed to    
    initialize a 4 x 4 matrix as shown in this image:

    .. code-block::    
        
        
           final int SIZE = _________;            // line 0    
           int matrix[][] = new int[SIZE][SIZE];  // line 1    
           for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)         // line 2    
           {    
               for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++)     // line 3    
               {    
                   if ( _________________ )       // line 4    
                   {    
                       matrix[i][j] = 4;          // line 5    
                   }    
                   else if ( _______________ )    // line 6    
                   {    
                       matrix[i][j] = 1;          // line 7    
                   }    
                   else    
                   {    
                       matrix[i][j] = 0;          // line 8    
                   }    
               }    
           }    
        
    Select statement from the choices below that is the best choice to fill in the    
    blank on ``line 4`` of this code segment so that it behaves as desired.    
    

    - ``i == j - 1``    
      

      - Line 4 controls where the "4" values are placed in the two-dimensional array.    
        They should be placed at all locations where i and j differ by 1.
    - ``i == j``    
      

      - Line 4 controls where the "4" values are placed in the two-dimensional array.    
        They should be placed at all locations where i and j differ by 1.
    - ``i == j + 1``    
      

      - Line 4 controls where the "4" values are placed in the two-dimensional array.    
        They should be placed at all locations where i and j differ by 1.
    - ``Math.abs(i - j) == 1``    
      

      + Correct!
    - None of these    
      

      - Line 4 controls where the "4" values are placed in the two-dimensional array.    
        They should be placed at all locations where i and j differ by 1.
