    If an inorder traversal of a complete binary tree visits the nodes in the    
    order ABCDEF (where each letter is the value of a node), which order are the    
    nodes visited during an postorder traversal?    
    

    - ABDECF    
      

      - DBACFE
    - DEBFCA    
      

      - DBACFE
    - DBFACE    
      

      - DBACFE
    - DBACFE    
      

      - DBACFE
    - ACBEFD    
      

      + Correct!
