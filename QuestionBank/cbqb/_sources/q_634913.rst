    In a hashtable that uses separate chaining to handle collisions, what, if any,    
    restrictions should be placed on the table size?    
    

    - Any number is fine, as the linear probing is guaranteed to find an element.    
      

      - With separate chaining, no probing is done. Each entry in the table is a    
        linked list, and all items with the hash index appear in the list.
    - Any number is fine, since probing is irrelevant.    
      

      + Correct!
    - It should be a prime number, to ensure that in probing we will test each node.    
      

      - With separate chaining, no probing is done. Each entry in the table is a    
        linked list, and all items with the hash index appear in the list.
    - It should be an odd number, to ensure that there's always a middle element.    
      

      - With separate chaining, no probing is done. Each entry in the table is a    
        linked list, and all items with the hash index appear in the list.
