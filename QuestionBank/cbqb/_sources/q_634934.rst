    What is the logic error in the following implementation of sequential search?    
        
    1  def sequentialSearch(listOfValues):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    2       target = input("value searching for: ")\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    3       listSize = len(listOfValues)\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    4       targetFound = False\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    5       targetLocation = 0\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    6       current = 0\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    7       while (current < listSize):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    8            if (listOfValues[current] == target):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    9                 targetFound = True\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    10               targetLocation = current    
        
    11          else:    
        
    12               targetFound = False\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    13          current = current + 1    
        
    14      if targetFound:\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    15           print "the target was found at location: ", targetLocation\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    16      else:\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    17          print "target was not found"    
    

    - Line 10    
      

      - The else clause resets  _targetFound_ if a match is ever found.  Hence, in    
        effect, with this else clause present, only the test with the last element in    
        the list is "remembered."

      + Correct!
    - Line 8

    - None of the above.
