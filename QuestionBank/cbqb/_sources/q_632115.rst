    Consider these lines of code:    
        
    txtName.SetFocus    
        
    txtName.SelStart = 0    
        
    txtName.SelLength = Len(txtName.Text)    
        
    txtName is an edit text box which is currently visible.    
        
    The code may cause a run time error. This will happen if:    
    

    - txtName is a multiline text box.    
      

      - A disabled edit text box may not be accessed by the setfocus method as this    
        combination is not a logical action and therefore clashes with the underlying    
        VB event model which controls the permissible sequences of events.
    - there is no text in txtName.    
      

      - A disabled edit text box may not be accessed by the setfocus method as this    
        combination is not a logical action and therefore clashes with the underlying    
        VB event model which controls the permissible sequences of events.
    - txtName is currently disabled.    
      

      + Correct!
    - some of the text in txtName is currently highlighted.    
      

      - A disabled edit text box may not be accessed by the setfocus method as this    
        combination is not a logical action and therefore clashes with the underlying    
        VB event model which controls the permissible sequences of events.
    - none of the text in txtName is currently highlighted.    
      

      - A disabled edit text box may not be accessed by the setfocus method as this    
        combination is not a logical action and therefore clashes with the underlying    
        VB event model which controls the permissible sequences of events.
