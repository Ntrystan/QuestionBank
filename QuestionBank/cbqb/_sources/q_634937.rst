       Given the above definition, what is the result of executing the following?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
       RecursiveMath bill = new RecursiveMath();    
       int x = bill.fib(-1);    
        
        
    ```    
    

    - x is set to -1    
      

      + Correct!
    - x is set to undefined    
      

      - Since fib is called with parameter of -1, a gets bound to -1.   Since a < 2,    
        the method returns the value of a, -1.
    - The code does not terminate    
      

      - Since fib is called with parameter of -1, a gets bound to -1.   Since a < 2,    
        the method returns the value of a, -1.
    - The code cannot be executed, because it won't compile    
      

      - Since fib is called with parameter of -1, a gets bound to -1.   Since a < 2,    
        the method returns the value of a, -1.
    - None of the above    
      

      - Since fib is called with parameter of -1, a gets bound to -1.   Since a < 2,    
        the method returns the value of a, -1.
