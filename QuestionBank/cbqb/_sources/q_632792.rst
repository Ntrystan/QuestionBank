    Does this compile?    
        
    ``int x=7.0``    
    

    - yes    
      

      - This doesn't compile.  Although 7.0 could be converted to an integer without    
        loss of precision, Java will not perform any conversion of a double to an int    
        without an explicit cast by the programmer.
    - no    
      

      + Correct!
    - It depends on the version of the compiler
