    What terminates a failed linear probe in a non-full hashtable?    
    

    - The end of the array    
      

      - A null entry marks the end of the probing sequence. Seeing the end of the    
        array isn't correct, since we need to examine all elements, including those    
        that appear before our original hash index. A node with a non-matching key is    
        what started our probe in the first place. Revisiting the original hash index    
        would mean we looked at every entry, but we could have stopped earlier at the    
        null entry. The purpose of leaving a deleted node in the table is so that    
        probing may proceed past it.

      + Correct!
