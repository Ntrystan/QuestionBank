    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           s = input('Enter a string: ')    
           w = ''    
           for c in s:    
              if c in "0123456789":    
                 #REPLACE    
              else:    
                 w = w + c    
           print(w)    
        
    What replacement statement for the comment ``#REPLACE will cause the code to    
    print out all of the characters up to the first digit?  In other words, if the    
    input is 'aaa3bb3c1', we should output 'aaa'.``    
    

    - break    
      

      + Correct!
    - continue    
      

      - B is wrong because `continue` will skip the digits but continue with the rest    
        of the String.    
            
        C is wrong because the exercise askes us to **PRINT** , not return the String.
    - return w    
      

      - B is wrong because `continue` will skip the digits but continue with the rest    
        of the String.    
            
        C is wrong because the exercise askes us to **PRINT** , not return the String.
    - any of the above will work    
      

      - B is wrong because `continue` will skip the digits but continue with the rest    
        of the String.    
            
        C is wrong because the exercise askes us to **PRINT** , not return the String.
    - none of the above    
      

      - B is wrong because `continue` will skip the digits but continue with the rest    
        of the String.    
            
        C is wrong because the exercise askes us to **PRINT** , not return the String.
