    What order must elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 be inserted in a binary    
    search tree such that the tree is perfectly balanced afterward?    
    

    - 4 1 2 3 5 6 7    
      

      - The middle element 4 will need to be the root, so that must be inserted first.    
        The middle elements of the remaining halves must be 4's children, so 2 and 6    
        must be inserted next. (Their relative order does not matter.) The last four    
        elements can be inserted in any order.
    - 4 2 6 1 3 5 7
