    Consider the following interface definition:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public interface Mover {    
              public int getX();    
              public int getY();    
              public void setLocation(int x, int y);    
           }    
        
    Choose the answer that best describes the following implementation of the    
    ``Mover`` interface:      
        
    ``public class CartoonCharacter implements Mover {``    
        
    ``public int getX();``    
        
    ``public int getY();``    
        
    ``public void setLocation(int x, int y);``    
        
    ``}``    
    

    - The implementation is correct, because it includes all the methods.    
      

      - A class that implements a Java interface must define all the methods required    
        by the interface (or declare itself abstract).    
            
        **NOTE:  **There is no appropriate topic for this question. Suggestion:

    - The implementation is correct, because the method names, return types, and    
      parameter lists match the interface.

    - The implementation is incorrect, because the method bodies are not included.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Both A and B.
