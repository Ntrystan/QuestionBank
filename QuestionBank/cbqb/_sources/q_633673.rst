    Suppose you want to write a Python function that takes a list as a parameter    
    and returns true if there are *no* instances of 3 immediately followed by a 4,    
    and false otherwise.  So this list returns True:  [ 3 5 4 ]  But this list    
    returns false: [ 1 2 3 4 5 ].    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           def no34(nums):    
             for i in range(len(nums)-1):    
               if nums[i]==3 and nums[i+1]==4:    
                 return False        #line1    
               else:    
                 return True         #line2    
             return False            #line3    
        
    What changes, if any, should be made to make this code correct    
    

    - No changes are necessary; it is correct as written    
      

      - The else clause should be removed.  If we don't see a 3-4, we can't conclude    
        anything about the rest of the list.
    - switch line1 and line2 (i.e return True for line1 and return False for line 2)    
      

      - The else clause should be removed.  If we don't see a 3-4, we can't conclude    
        anything about the rest of the list.
    - delete line2 (take the else statement with it)    
      

      + Correct!
    - switch line1 and line2 (i.e return True for line1 and return False for line 2)    
          
      and    
          
      delete line2 (take the else statement with it)    
      

      - The else clause should be removed.  If we don't see a 3-4, we can't conclude    
        anything about the rest of the list.
    - switch line2 and line3 (i.e return False for line2 and return True for line3)    
      

      - The else clause should be removed.  If we don't see a 3-4, we can't conclude    
        anything about the rest of the list.
