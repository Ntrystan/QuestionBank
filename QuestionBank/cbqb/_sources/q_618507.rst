    In a program 5 objects are created initially and inserted into a vector. These    
    objects increase to 64 during the execution of the program. Each time 8    
    objects is added to the vector except the last time in which 3 objects is    
    added. Which of the following definition results in better performance in    
    terms of execution time and allocated space at the end?    
    

    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      Vector\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Object>` objectVect = new Vector\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Object>`\ (5,8);    
      

      - Vector<Object> objectVect = new Vector<Object>(8,5);
    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      Vector\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Object>` objectVect = new Vector\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Object>`\ (8);    
      

      + Correct!
    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      Vector\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Object>` objectVect = new Vector\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Object>`\ (8,5);    
      

      - Vector<Object> objectVect = new Vector<Object>(8,5);
    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      Vector\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Object>` objectVect = new Vector\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Object>`\ (5);    
      

      - Vector<Object> objectVect = new Vector<Object>(8,5);
