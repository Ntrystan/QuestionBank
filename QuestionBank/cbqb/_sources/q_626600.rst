    1. What is the value of the following Java arithmetic expression?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
                              ` 4 * 3 + 6 / 4`    
    

    - 4    
      

      - This question addresses two points: first, operator precedence (multiplication    
        and division are both done before addition) and second, integer division.    
        Answer A is wrong about operator precedence: the answer you get if you apply    
        the operators in order from left to right. Answer B makes the same mistake and    
        is also wrong about integer division. Answer D is the answer you get if you    
        assume that addition has a higher precedence than the other two operations.    
        Answer E gets the operator precedence right, but is wrong about integer    
        division. Answer C is the only one that has both right.
