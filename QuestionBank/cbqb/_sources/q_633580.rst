    The number of elements in a hashtable must be prime    
    

    - so that linear probing will terminate    
      

      - Since the double hash produces a fixed step size for probing, it may be the    
        case that the step size is a factor of the table size. In this case, advancing    
        by the fixed step size will land us in a cycling sequence.
    - so that quadratic probing will terminate

    - to reduce collisions

    - so that probing with a double hash visits all elements    
      

      + Correct!
