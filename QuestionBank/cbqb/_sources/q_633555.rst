    If a hashtable's array is resized to reduce collisions, what must be done to    
    the elements that have already been inserted?    
    

    - All items must be copied over to the same indices in the new array.    
      

      - Since calculating a node's position in the hashtable is a function of the    
        node's key's hashcode and the array size, all items must be reinserted.
    - Nodes must be rehashed and reinserted in the new array.    
      

      + Correct!
    - The existing items can be placed anywhere in the new array.    
      

      - Since calculating a node's position in the hashtable is a function of the    
        node's key's hashcode and the array size, all items must be reinserted.
    - The hashCode method must be updated.
