    William has the hash function: hash function h(k) = (sum of the digits) % 10.    
    He wants to hash 33, 60, 24, 42 and 6.    
        
    Which collision resolution method should he chose in his implementation, if he    
    wants to ensure that adding 80 happens in O(1) time?    
    

    - Quadratic probing    
      

      + Correct!
    - Linear probing    
      

      - Both Rth probing (R=2) and linear probing will hash values to the 8 position    
        -- only quadratic probing will leave that position open.
    - Rth probing, R = 2    
      

      - Both Rth probing (R=2) and linear probing will hash values to the 8 position    
        -- only quadratic probing will leave that position open.
