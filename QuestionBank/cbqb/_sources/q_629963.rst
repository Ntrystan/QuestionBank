    Suppose you have a sorted list stored in consecutive locations in a Java    
    array. What is the worst-case time complexity of inserting a new element in    
    the list?    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - In order to make room for a new element in the array, it may be necessary to    
        shift all the other elements.

    - O(log n)    
      

      - In order to make room for a new element in the array, it may be necessary to    
        shift all the other elements.

    - O(n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n log n)    
      

      - In order to make room for a new element in the array, it may be necessary to    
        shift all the other elements.

    - O(n2)    
      

      - In order to make room for a new element in the array, it may be necessary to    
        shift all the other elements.
