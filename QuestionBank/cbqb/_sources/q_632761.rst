    This question refers to a method "swap", for which part of the code is shown    
    below:    
        
    ``public static void swap(int[] x, int i, int j) {``    
        
     // swaps elements "i" and "j" of array "x".    
        
    ``int temp;``     // temporary storage for swapping    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
       xxx missing code goes here xxx    
        
        
    ``} // method swap``    
        
    The missing code from "swap" is:    
    

    - [code]    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         temp = x[i];

         x[j] = temp;
