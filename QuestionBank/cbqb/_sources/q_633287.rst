    What is returned by ``'A' < 'A Linkletter'``\ ?    
    

    - True    
      

      + Correct!
    - False    
      

      - This is a lexicographic (i.e. alphabetic) comparison, but the first String 'A'    
        is a substring of the second String.  We fall back on the "nothing before    
        something" principle, and return True, because when sorting Strings, nothing    
        comes before something.  This is why the word 'a' comes before 'aardvark' in    
        the dictionary, as well as why 'ant' comes before 'anteater' and 'the' comes    
        before 'these' or 'then'.
    - 'A'

    - an error

    - none of the above
