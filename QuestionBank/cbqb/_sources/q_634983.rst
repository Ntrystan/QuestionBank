    The *All-Pairs* list programming pattern typically runs in time?    
    

    - O(n2)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n)    
      

      - The _All-Pairs_ programming pattern typically compares each element in a list    
        to each other element in the list.  Hence the first element is compared    
        against n-1 other values.  The second element is compared against n-2 other    
        values, etc.  Hence one gets a quadratic run time.
    - O(n log2 n)
