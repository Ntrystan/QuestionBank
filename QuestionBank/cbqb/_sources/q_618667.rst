    We have defined two JButton in a class and are going to handle the events by    
    implementing ActionListener. As we know, this interface has a method called    
    actionPerformed that we have to override it in our class. What would be the    
    best way (i.e. object oriented approach) to listen to the events regarding    
    both the buttons?    
    

    - Override actionPerformed method twice for both the buttons.    
      

      - Create two separate classes, each should implements ActionListener interface.    
        Then register each button with each classes.
    - Override actionPerformed method once, get the source of event in this method    
      and then handle the events.    
      

      - Create two separate classes, each should implements ActionListener interface.    
        Then register each button with each classes.
    - Create two separate classes, each should implements ActionListener interface.    
      Then register each button with each classes.    
      

      - Create two separate classes, each should implements ActionListener interface.    
        Then register each button with each classes.
    - use inner classes, each implements ActionListener interface. Each button    
      should be registered with one of these inner classes.    
      

      + Correct!
