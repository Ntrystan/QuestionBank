    Assume this Perl subroutine is called like this:    
        
    &compare(6, 4);    
        
    sub compare    
        
    {    
        
      my $ret = 0;    
        
      if($\ *[0] > $*\ [1])    
        
      {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
          $ret = 1;    
        
        
       }    
        
      elsif($\ *[0] < $*\ [1])    
        
      {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
          $ret = -1;    
        
        
      }    
        
      return $ret;    
        
    }    
        
    What will the subroutine return?    
    

    - -1    
      

      - 6 (the first parameter) is greater than 4 (the second parameter) so it returns    
        1
    - 0    
      

      - 6 (the first parameter) is greater than 4 (the second parameter) so it returns    
        1
    - 1    
      

      + Correct!
    - undef    
      

      - 6 (the first parameter) is greater than 4 (the second parameter) so it returns    
        1
