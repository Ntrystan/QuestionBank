    Which of the following run-times is NOT characteristic of a *feasible* (or    
    *tractable* ) algorithm?    
    

    - O(n2)    
      

      - Feasable (or tractable) algorithms are one whose time is expressed as a    
        polynomial in terms of the input set size n.  O(2n) is exponential in n.
    - O(nlog2 n)    
      

      - Feasable (or tractable) algorithms are one whose time is expressed as a    
        polynomial in terms of the input set size n.  O(2n) is exponential in n.
    - O(2n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n3)

        polynomial in terms of the input set size n.  O(2n) is exponential in n.
    - O(log2 n)
