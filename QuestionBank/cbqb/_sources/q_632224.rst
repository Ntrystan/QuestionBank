    The ``StackADT``\ 's ``push`` operation:    
    

    - adds a new item at the bottom of the Stack    
      

      - "push" is the traditional term for adding a new item to a stack. Stacks work    
        like a pile of paper. The bottom piece of paper is the first one that was put    
        in the pile. The top piece of paper was added most recently. When another    
        piece of paper is added to the stack, it goes on top of the rest of the pile.
    - returns without removing the top item on the Stack
