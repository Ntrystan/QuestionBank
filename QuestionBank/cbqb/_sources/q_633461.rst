    What does the following Java code print?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int sum=0;    
           for (int i=1; i<=5; i++) {    
              sum += i;    
           }    
           System.out.println(sum);    
    

    - 0    
      

      - This is basically 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    - 5    
      

      - This is basically 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    - 10    
      

      - This is basically 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    - 15
