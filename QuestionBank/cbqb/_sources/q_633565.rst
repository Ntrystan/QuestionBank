    You know exactly how much data you need to store, but there's not much of it.    
    You do not need to be able to search the collection quickly, but insertion    
    should be as fast as possible. What is the simplest data structure that best    
    suits for your needs?    
    

    - Unordered array    
      

      + Correct!
    - Ordered array    
      

      - If you know the memory needs, you can allocate a large enough array. Inserting    
        elements in the array can be done in constant time, and requires less work    
        than inserting in a linked list.
    - Linked list
