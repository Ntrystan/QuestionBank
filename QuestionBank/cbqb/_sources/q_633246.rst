    For a graph with N nodes, what's the minimum number of edges it must have for    
    it to contain a cycle?    
    

    - N + 1    
      

      - A vertex with an edge to itself is a cycle.
    - N    
      

      - A vertex with an edge to itself is a cycle.
    - N - 1    
      

      - A vertex with an edge to itself is a cycle.
    - 1    
      

      + Correct!
    - 2
