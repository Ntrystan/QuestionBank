    Assuming "FRED" is an ASCII text file which opens correctly, what will be    
    displayed by this code?    
        
    define MAX 128    
    ==============    
        
    FILE *pFile = fopen("FRED", "r");    
        
    unsigned uCount = 0;    
        
    while(!feof(pFile))    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        char ch;    
        
        ch = fgetc(pFile);    
        
        uCount++;    
        
        
    }    
        
    printf("%u", uCount);    
    

    - The number of characters in the file    
      

      + Correct!
    - The number of words in the file    
      

      - The function reads the file character by character and increments a counter on    
        each read, the result of which is printed on reaching the end of file giving    
        the total character count in the file
    - The number of sentences in the file
