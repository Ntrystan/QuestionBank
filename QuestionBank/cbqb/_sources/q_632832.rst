    Consider the following code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           if x >= 0:    
               print (1)    
           elif x < 20:    
               print(2)    
           else:    
               print(3)    
           print(4)    
        
    For what values of x will 2 be among the values printed?    
    

    - ``x < 0``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``x >= 0``    
      

      - Although the condition of the elif is x<20, all values between 0 and 20 are    
        subsumed (i.e. covered by) the first condition, x>=0.  So only values of x    
        strictly less than 0 will result in 2 being printed.
    - ``x < 20``    
      

      - Although the condition of the elif is x<20, all values between 0 and 20 are    
        subsumed (i.e. covered by) the first condition, x>=0.  So only values of x    
        strictly less than 0 will result in 2 being printed.
    - All values of ``x``    
      

      - Although the condition of the elif is x<20, all values between 0 and 20 are    
        subsumed (i.e. covered by) the first condition, x>=0.  So only values of x    
        strictly less than 0 will result in 2 being printed.
    - None of the above
