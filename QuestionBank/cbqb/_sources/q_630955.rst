    Which of the following choices would best be modeled by a class, followed by a    
    subclass of that class?    
    

    - CountryInAfrica, Botswana    
      

      - Choices A and B are wrong, because one of the items listed is a concrete item    
        that would be better modeled by an object. Choice E is wrong because both    
        items listed are concrete. Choices C and D both list a class and a subclass,    
        but only in Choice D does the class come first, followed by the subclass.
