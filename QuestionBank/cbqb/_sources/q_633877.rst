    Amr wants to use quicksort to sort the series [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,    
    11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. What choice of pivot will yield the **least**    
    efficient code?    
    

    - The first element of a sublist    
      

      + Correct!
    - The middle element of a sublist    
      

      - For a ascending sorted list, quicksort partitioning on the smallest element    
        will be O(n^2).
    - A random element of a sublist    
      

      - For a ascending sorted list, quicksort partitioning on the smallest element    
        will be O(n^2).
