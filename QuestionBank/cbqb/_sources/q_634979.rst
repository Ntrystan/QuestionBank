    An NP-Complete problem is:    
    

    - solvable, and the best known solution runs in polynomial time (i.e. feasible)    
      

      - NP-Complete problems typically have rather simplistic algorithmic solutions.    
        The problem is that these solutions require exponential time to run.
    - solvable, and the best known solution is not feasible (i.e. runs in    
      exponential time)    
      

      + Correct!
    - currently unsolvable, but researchers are hoping to find a solution.    
      

      - NP-Complete problems typically have rather simplistic algorithmic solutions.    
        The problem is that these solutions require exponential time to run.
    - provably unsolvable: it has been shown that this problem has no algorithmic    
      solution.
