    Java uses:    
    

    - call by reference    
      

      - Java uses call by value.  If the given parameter is an object, which is really    
        a reference, then under call by value, the formal parameter is really just an    
        alias (additional reference) to the actual parameter object.
    - call by value

    - call by name

    - call by value-return
