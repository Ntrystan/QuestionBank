    Suppose you try to perform a binary search on the unsorted array {1, 4, 3, 7,    
    15, 9, 24}. Which element will not be found when you try searching for it?    
    

    - 7    
      

      - The answer is 15. The first check will look at 7. 15 is greater than 7, so we    
        search to its right. The second check will look at 9. 15 is greater than 9, so    
        we search to its right. The third check will look at 24. 15 is less than 24,    
        so we look to its left. However, our range has just been inverted and our    
        searching stops, not having found 15.
    - 1    
      

      - The answer is 15. The first check will look at 7. 15 is greater than 7, so we    
        search to its right. The second check will look at 9. 15 is greater than 9, so    
        we search to its right. The third check will look at 24. 15 is less than 24,    
        so we look to its left. However, our range has just been inverted and our

    - 9    
      

      - The answer is 15. The first check will look at 7. 15 is greater than 7, so we    
        search to its right. The second check will look at 9. 15 is greater than 9, so    
        we search to its right. The third check will look at 24. 15 is less than 24,    
        so we look to its left. However, our range has just been inverted and our

    - 15    
      

      + Correct!
    - 24
