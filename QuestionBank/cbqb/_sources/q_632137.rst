    What is output by the code shown below. Think about it carefully - it may be a    
    bit tricky!    
        
    define DEF_1 (2 + 2)    
    ====================    
        
    define DEF_2 DEF_1 - DEF_1    
    ==========================    
        
    int main(void)    
        
    {    
        
    printf("%d", DEF_2);    
        
    }    
    

    - 0    
      

      + Correct!
    - 2    
      

      - The declaration of DEF_2 [DEF_1 after subtracting DEF_1 = 0 ] is the value    
        printed.
    - 4    
      

      - The declaration of DEF_2 [DEF_1 after subtracting DEF_1 = 0 ] is the value    
        printed.
    - 6    
      

      - The declaration of DEF_2 [DEF_1 after subtracting DEF_1 = 0 ] is the value    
        printed.
    - 8    
      

      - The declaration of DEF_2 [DEF_1 after subtracting DEF_1 = 0 ] is the value    
        printed.
