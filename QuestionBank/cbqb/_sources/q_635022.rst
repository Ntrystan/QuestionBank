    Suppose ``s`` is an instance of a stack that can store Strings, and I execute    
    the following statements starting with ``s`` empty:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           1. s.push("Iceland");    
           2. s.push("is");    
           3. String w = s.peek();    
           4. String x = s.pop();    
           5. s.push("cool");    
           6. String y = s.pop();    
           7. boolean z = s.isEmpty();    
        
    What is the value of z after executing this sequence of expressions?    
    

    - ``"Iceland"``    
      

      - In the sequence of operations, we pushed 3 things onto the stack, and only    
        popped 2 off (and at no point had we popped more times than we pushed).  So    
        the stack is not empty.
    - ``"cool"``    
      

      - In the sequence of operations, we pushed 3 things onto the stack, and only    
        popped 2 off (and at no point had we popped more times than we pushed).  So    
        the stack is not empty.
    - ``true``    
      

      - In the sequence of operations, we pushed 3 things onto the stack, and only    
        popped 2 off (and at no point had we popped more times than we pushed).  So    
        the stack is not empty.
    - ``false``    
      

      + Correct!
    - None of the above    
      

      - In the sequence of operations, we pushed 3 things onto the stack, and only    
        popped 2 off (and at no point had we popped more times than we pushed).  So    
        the stack is not empty.
