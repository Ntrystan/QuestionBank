    What wil the following code print, assuming that N is a positive integer?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int count=0;    
           for (int i=0; i< **N** ; i++) {    
              if (i % 2 == 0) {    
                 count++;    
              }    
           }    
           System.out.println(count);    
    

    - N    
      

      - If N is even, for example N=12, N/2 works.  However, suppose N is odd, for    
        example N=13.  Here the result should be 7, which is (N+1)/2.  However, for    
        N=12, (N+1)/2 also works.  (N+1)/2 works for all positive integer.
    - N/2

    - (N+1)/2    
      

      + Correct!
    - 0 (i.e. the loop body never executes)
