    What happens if you forget to define the ``equals`` method for your key class    
    used to insert elements into a hashtable?    
    

    - The elements can be inserted but remain inaccessible.    
      

      - When a key lookup is performed, we will find the hashtable location and then    
        compare the keys using Object.equals. Object.equals returns true only when the    
        two keys refer to the same object.
    - Inserting an element will raise an exception.    
      

      - When a key lookup is performed, we will find the hashtable location and then    
        compare the keys using Object.equals. Object.equals returns true only when the    
        two keys refer to the same object.
    - Elements can be inserted and retrieved only by using the same key instances    
      used to insert the elements.    
      

      + Correct!
    - All elements will map to the same location in the table.
