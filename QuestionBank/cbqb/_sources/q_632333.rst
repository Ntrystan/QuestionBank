    This Bash command was supposed to run a Perl script, exE1.pl from a University    
    student's bin directory on the Cislinux server, passing it a command line    
    argument which was a text file in the copy area. It was supposed to put the    
    results into a text file in the student's bin directory.    
        
    ~/bin/exE1.pl /copy/ex/exe-1.txt > /bin/exe1out.txt    
        
    Why will this give an error?    
    

    - ~ cannot be used at the start of a line    
      

      - The /bin directory has restricted access for security reasons to prevent    
        students running unauthorised code on the server or modifyng or overwriting    
        other programs in the directory
    - .txt is not a valid extension in linux    
      

      - The /bin directory has restricted access for security reasons to prevent    
        students running unauthorised code on the server or modifyng or overwriting    
        other programs in the directory
    - ..    
          
         does not redirect output    
          
      

      - The /bin directory has restricted access for security reasons to prevent    
        students running unauthorised code on the server or modifyng or overwriting
