    Consider the following short program:    
        
    include <stdio.h>    
    =================    
        
    void f1(void);    
        
    int a;    
        
    void main(void)    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        int b;    
        
        a = b = 1;    
        
        f1();    
        
        printf("%d %d", a, b);    
        
        
    }    
        
    void f1(void)    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        int b = 3;    
        
        a = b;    
        
        
    }    
        
    The output from the print statement will be:
