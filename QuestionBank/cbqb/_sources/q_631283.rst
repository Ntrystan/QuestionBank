    Suppose you have a list of numbers stored in consecutive locations in a Java    
    array. What is the worst-case time complexity of finding a given element in    
    the array using linear search?    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - Linear search is O(n).
    - O(log n)    
      

      - Linear search is O(n).
    - O(n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n log n)    
      

      - Linear search is O(n).
    - O(n2)    
      

      - Linear search is O(n).
