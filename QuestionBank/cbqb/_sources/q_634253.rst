      - The variable `totalA` is being used as an accumulator to keep track of how    
        many A's have been seen so far as the loop progresses.  The if condition    
        inside the loop is intended to detect whether the current character is an "A",    
        and so the variable `totalA` should be incremented each time the condition is    
        true.  Therefore, the best answer for Line 6 is 1, so that `totalA` is    
        incremented.
