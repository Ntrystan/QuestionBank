    Which of the following is true?    
    

    - The array ``_balls`` is unchanged in myPanel    
      

      - C is true.  When you call ballCopy, it instantiates an array that is twice as    
        large as _balls, which had length 10, then sets _balls to that new array.
    - The elements of ``temp`` are copies of the elements of _balls in myPanel    
      

      - C is true.  When you call ballCopy, it instantiates an array that is twice as    
        large as _balls, which had length 10, then sets _balls to that new array.
    - ``_balls.length == 20`` in myPanel    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``_balls.length == 10 in myPanel``    
      

      - C is true.  When you call ballCopy, it instantiates an array that is twice as    
        large as _balls, which had length 10, then sets _balls to that new array.
    - None of the above    
      

      - C is true.  When you call ballCopy, it instantiates an array that is twice as    
        large as _balls, which had length 10, then sets _balls to that new array.
