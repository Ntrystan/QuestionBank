    Assume that an object of the following class has just been created:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class Unknown    
           {    
               private int x;    
        
               public Unknown()    
               {    
                   x = 17;    
                   method1();    
                   method2(5);    
                   method3();    
                   System.out.println(x);      // Line D    
               }    
        
               public void method1()    
               {    
                   --x;    
                   int x = this.x;    
                   x++;    
                   System.out.println(this.x); // Line A    
               }    
        
               public void method2(int x)    
               {    
                   x++;    
                   System.out.println(x);      // Line B    
               }    
        
               public void method3()    
               {    
                   --x;    
                   int x = 2;    
                   x++;    
                   System.out.println(x);      // Line C    
               }    
           }    
        
    What output is produced by **Line D** when an instance of this class is    
    created?    
    

    - 2    
      

      - Line D prints the value of the field called `x`.  That field is initialized to    
        17 in the constructor, and then decremented on the first line of `method1()`,    
        and decremented again on the first line of `method3()`, so by the time    
        execution reaches the `println()` method call at the end of the constructor,    
        the value printed is 15.

      + Correct!
