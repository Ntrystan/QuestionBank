    Suppose you are defining a Java ``ProductItem`` class to store information about    
    the inventory in a store, and you want to give the class an instance variable    
    for the number of those items currently in stock. Choose the best datatype for    
    modeling this number:    
    

    - ``double``    
      

      - A and B are wrong because you want to model an integer, not a floating point    
        number.    
            
        E is wrong because you probably want to use this number for adding and    
        subtracting, not just for display.    
            
        D is less good than C, because the built-in operations on ints will most    
        likely be sufficient for the purposes of this variable.
    - ``float``    
      

      - A and B are wrong because you want to model an integer, not a floating point    
        number.    
            
        E is wrong because you probably want to use this number for adding and    
        subtracting, not just for display.    
            
        D is less good than C, because the built-in operations on ints will most    
        likely be sufficient for the purposes of this variable.
    - ``int``    
      

      + Correct!
    - a user-defined ``NumberInStock`` class    
      

      - A and B are wrong because you want to model an integer, not a floating point    
        number.    
            
        E is wrong because you probably want to use this number for adding and    
        subtracting, not just for display.    
            
        D is less good than C, because the built-in operations on ints will most    
        likely be sufficient for the purposes of this variable.
    - ``String``    
      

      - A and B are wrong because you want to model an integer, not a floating point    
        number.    
            
        E is wrong because you probably want to use this number for adding and    
        subtracting, not just for display.
