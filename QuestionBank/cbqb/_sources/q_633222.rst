    What are the merits of insertion sort compared to bubble sort and selection    
    sort?    
    

    - It doesn't require as much extra storage.    
      

      - Neither selection nor bubble sort require extra storage. Selection sort    
        doesn't make unnecessary copies. Bubble sort can be expressed in very little    
        code. Any of them could be expressed recursively. If the array is already    
        sorted, then insertion sort will only make N comparisons and no copies, giving    
        it better performance than the other sorts.
    - It copies elements only to their final locations.

    - It is faster for already sorted data.    
      

      + Correct!
    - It can be implement recursively.
