    Which of the following is the best definition of an algorithm?    
    

    - A well-ordered collection of unambiguous and effectively computable operations    
      that when executed produces a result and halts in a reasonably short amount of    
      time.    
      

      - Option B provides the best definition.  A key component is that in order to be    
        an algorithm, it must eventually halt.
    - A well-ordered collection of unambiguous and effectively computable operations    
      that when executed produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time.    
      

      + Correct!

      executed produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time.
