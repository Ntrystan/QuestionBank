    Your data has 4-bit keys. You also have magical, perfect hash function that    
    will prevent any collisions from happening, provided there is room enough for    
    all possible elements in the array. What's the minimum number of elements the    
    array must be able to hold?    
    

    - 8    
      

      - 4-bit keys uniquely identify 24 = 16 elements. The array must be able to hold    
        these 16 items.
