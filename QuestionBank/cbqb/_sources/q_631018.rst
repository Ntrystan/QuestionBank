    In Java, what value will the variable ``d`` have after this declaration:    
        
    ``double d = 18 / 4;``    
    

    - ``4.0``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``4.5``    
      

      - While the variable `d` is being declared as a `double`, the initial value    
        provided on the righthand side is actually an `int` expression, consisting of    
        one integer value divided by another.  When the `int` expression is evaluated,    
        its result is also an `int` and any fractional part is truncated.  The value    
        of `18 / 4` is `4` (an `int`).  After this `int` value is produced, it is then    
        promoted to a `double` value when initializing the variable `d`, giving `d`    
        the initial value `4.0`.
    - ``18.4``

    - None of these
