    2. Consider the following class definition:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class SillyTestClass {    
              public SillyTestClass(int x, int y) {    
                 System.out.println(y);    
              }    
              public SillyTestClass(String string1, String string2) {    
                 System.out.println(string2);    
              }    
              public static void main (String [ ] args) {    
                 SillyTestClass app = new SillyTestClass(20, "Try this!");    
              }    
           }    
        
    Which of the following is the most accurate statement about this code?    
    

    - The class definition won't compile, because it has two constructors.    
      

      - Answer A is wrong because Java programs can have more than one constructor.    
        Answer B is wrong because a variation between the type of the parameters is    
        also sufficient. Answers D and E are wrong because the program won't compile    
        or execute. Answer C identifies the problem.
    - The class definition won't compile, because two constructors have the same    
      number of parameters.    
      

      - Answer A is wrong because Java programs can have more than one constructor.    
        Answer B is wrong because a variation between the type of the parameters is    
        also sufficient. Answers D and E are wrong because the program won't compile    
        or execute. Answer C identifies the problem.
    - The class definition won't compile, because the actual and formal parameter    
      types don't match.    
      

      + Correct!
    - It will compile, and the output when the ``main`` method is executed will be: 20    
      

      - Answer A is wrong because Java programs can have more than one constructor.    
        Answer B is wrong because a variation between the type of the parameters is    
        also sufficient. Answers D and E are wrong because the program won't compile

    - It will compile, and the output when the ``main`` method is executed will be:    
      Try this!
