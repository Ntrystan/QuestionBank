    consider the section of code below:    
        
    int a = 3, b = 4, c = 5;    
        
    x = a * b <= c    
        
    What will x be after executing this code?    
    

    - 0    
      

      + Correct!
    - 1    
      

      - Due to the precedence of operators here, first a and b are multiplied and then    
        the total [12] is compared with c [5].  If the logical comparison evaluates to    
        true x assumes the value 1,  otherwise (as in this case) , it evaluates to    
        false and x assumes the value 0.
