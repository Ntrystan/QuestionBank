    Barack Obama wants to know the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit    
    integers. He knows it's not bubble sort. What is?    
    

    - Heapsort    
      

      - Radix sort will be O(n) and works nicely on integers; at such a large scale it    
        will outperform the O(nlgn) sorting algorithms.    
            
        (question is a reference to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8 )
    - Insertion sort    
      

      - Radix sort will be O(n) and works nicely on integers; at such a large scale it    
        will outperform the O(nlgn) sorting algorithms.

    - Mergesort    
      

      - Radix sort will be O(n) and works nicely on integers; at such a large scale it    
        will outperform the O(nlgn) sorting algorithms.

    - Radix sort    
      

      + Correct!
    - Quicksort    
      

      - Radix sort will be O(n) and works nicely on integers; at such a large scale it    
        will outperform the O(nlgn) sorting algorithms.
