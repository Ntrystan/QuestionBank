    Mohamed has a brute force solution for vertex covering that takes one    
    milisecond to test a possible vertex covering. The large graph has 64 nodes,    
    so there are 264\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    possibilities (approx 1.85 * 1019 ). (There are 1000 ms in a second.) How long    
    will Mohamed's code take to run?    
    

    - about 500,000 days    
      

      - ((1 / 1000*60*60*24) day ) * 1.85 * 10^19  = about 2 * 10^11 days -- so not A.    
            
        2 * 10^11 days is about 5 * 10^8 years.
    - about 500,000 years

      + Correct!
