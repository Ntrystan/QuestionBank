    You've got this code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           TreeMap<String, String> map = new TreeMap<String, String>();    
           map.put("A", "*");    
           map.put("AA", "*");    
           map.put("B", "****");    
           for (String s : map.keySet()) {    
             System.out.print(map.get(s) + " ");    
           }    
        
    What does it print?    
    

    - A A B    
      

      - We iterate through each key {"A", "AA", "B"}, looking up and printing the    
        value of these keys.
    - ----    
      

      + Correct!
    - A\ * AA* B\ ****    
      

      - We iterate through each key {"A", "AA", "B"}, looking up and printing the    
        value of these keys.
    - A AA B    
      

      - We iterate through each key {"A", "AA", "B"}, looking up and printing the    
        value of these keys.
