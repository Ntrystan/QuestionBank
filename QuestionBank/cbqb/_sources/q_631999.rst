    Which of the following assertions about methods is correct?    
    

    - The body of a method must contain at least one return statement.    
      

      - (a) and (b) are true of functions, but not of Java methods in general. (c) is    
        incorrect. Methods in general and functions specifically can be written with    
        or without parameters. (d) is correct: methods without a return statement    
        can't be on the right-hand side of an assignment statement, because they don't    
        have a value. And if (d) is correct, (e) must be wrong.
    - A method must return a value.    
      

      - (a) and (b) are true of functions, but not of Java methods in general. (c) is    
        incorrect. Methods in general and functions specifically can be written with    
        or without parameters. (d) is correct: methods without a return statement    
        can't be on the right-hand side of an assignment statement, because they don't    
        have a value. And if (d) is correct, (e) must be wrong.
    - A method invocation must contain at least one argument.    
      

      - (a) and (b) are true of functions, but not of Java methods in general. (c) is    
        incorrect. Methods in general and functions specifically can be written with    
        or without parameters. (d) is correct: methods without a return statement    
        can't be on the right-hand side of an assignment statement, because they don't    
        have a value. And if (d) is correct, (e) must be wrong.
    - A method with no return statement must not be invoked on the right side of an    
      assignment statement.
