    Consider the following class for a Ninja:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class Ninja {    
             private int honor;    
             public Ninja(int h) {    
              this.honor=h;    
             }    
           }    
        
    Suppose we instantiate two Ninjas like this:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           Ninja n1=new Ninja(50);    
           Ninja n2=new Ninja(50);    
        
    Is the following statement True, False, or It Depends:    
        
    n1 == n2    
    

    - True    
      

      - These two references are not equal because they reference different instances.    
            
        ![](img/10.png)
    - False    
      

      + Correct!
    - It depends    
          
      (Note:  Be ready to explain what it depends upon during the discussion phase    
      of this question)    
      

      - These two references are not equal because they reference different instances.
