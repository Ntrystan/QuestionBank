    Given the above binary tree rooted at Node A, what is the order of nodes    
    visited by a breadth-first traversal?    
    

    - A, B, C, D, E, F, G    
      

      + Correct!
    - A, B, D, E, C, F, G    
      

      - A breadth-first traversal procedes by levels --  the root, then all of the    
        nodes that are children of the root, then all of the nodes that are    
        grandchildren of the root, etc.    
            
        In this case we get:    
            
        Visit A (the root)    
            
        Visit B, C (children of the root)    
            
        Visit D, E, F, G (grandchildren of the root)    
            
        This corresponds to answer A.
    - D, B, E, A, F, C, G    
      

      - A breadth-first traversal procedes by levels --  the root, then all of the    
        nodes that are children of the root, then all of the nodes that are    
        grandchildren of the root, etc.    
            
        In this case we get:    
            
        Visit A (the root)    
            
        Visit B, C (children of the root)    
            
        Visit D, E, F, G (grandchildren of the root)    
            
        This corresponds to answer A.
    - D, E, B, F, G, C, A
