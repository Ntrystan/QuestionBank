    Suppose you have a Java array of ints. The worst-case time complexity of    
    printing out the elements in the list is:    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - If we assume that printing a single value can be done in constant time for    
        some constant k, then printing n values can be done in kn time, which is O(n).
    - O(log n)    
      

      - If we assume that printing a single value can be done in constant time for    
        some constant k, then printing n values can be done in kn time, which is O(n).
    - O(n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n log n)    
      

      - If we assume that printing a single value can be done in constant time for    
        some constant k, then printing n values can be done in kn time, which is O(n).
    - O(n2)    
      

      - If we assume that printing a single value can be done in constant time for    
        some constant k, then printing n values can be done in kn time, which is O(n).
