    Consider a picture that is x pixels wide and y pixels tall.  Furthermore,    
    consider storing the x*y pixels in a one-dimensional array which stores the    
    pixels in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom manner.    
        
    Consider the following code:    
        
    def pixelSwap (pixels):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
         pixCount = len(pixels) - 1\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
         for p in range (0, len(pixels)/2):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
              tempPixel = pixels[p]\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
              pixels[p] = pixels[pixCount - p]\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
              pixels[pixCount - p] = tempPixel    
        
    If the array of pixels originally represented the following picture:    
        
        
    .. image:: img/11.jpg    
       :target: img/11.jpg    
       :alt: no description    
        
        
    Which of the following pictures represents the pixel array after invoking    
    pixelSwap?    
    

    - The picture is unchanged.    
      

      - The first pixel becomes the last, the second pixel, becomes the second last,    
        etc.  This is a list reversing algorithm.  For a picture, the result is to    
        rotate it 180 degrees.
    - The picture is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.    
      

      - The first pixel becomes the last, the second pixel, becomes the second last,    
        etc.  This is a list reversing algorithm.  For a picture, the result is to    
        rotate it 180 degrees.
    - The picture is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.    
      

      - The first pixel becomes the last, the second pixel, becomes the second last,    
        etc.  This is a list reversing algorithm.  For a picture, the result is to    
        rotate it 180 degrees.
    - The picture is rotated 180 degress.    
      

      + Correct!
    - None of the above.    
      

      - The first pixel becomes the last, the second pixel, becomes the second last,    
        etc.  This is a list reversing algorithm.  For a picture, the result is to    
        rotate it 180 degrees.
