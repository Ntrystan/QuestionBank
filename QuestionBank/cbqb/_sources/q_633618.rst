    True or False:    
        
    Breadth-first search (BFS) and Depth-first search (DFS) visit nodes of a graph    
    in the same order only if the graph looks like a linear chain, or linked list,    
    and the traversal starts at one of the ends.    
        
    For example, BFS and DFS starting at node A are the same for the following    
    graph:    
        
    A <-> B <-> C    
    

    - True    
      

      - We could add any number of nodes to node B, and visit nodes in the same order    
        starting at node A and node B.
    - False    
      

      + Correct!
