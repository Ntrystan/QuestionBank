    Dhruv has some recursive code that contains the base case ``if(left > right)``    
        
    Which algorithm is he *most* likely to be implementing?    
    

    - heapsort    
      

      - Only quicksort is usually implemented with such a base case.
    - insertion sort    
      

      - Only quicksort is usually implemented with such a base case.
    - quicksort    
      

      + Correct!
    - Fibonacci    
      

      - Only quicksort is usually implemented with such a base case.
