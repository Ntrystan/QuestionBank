    The simplified UML diagram above shows the relationships among classes Bird,    
    Crow, and Duck.    
        
    Suppose Russell is an instance of Crow and Howard is an instance of Duck.    
        
    Which of the following is incorrect?    
    

    - Howard is an instance of Bird    
      

      - A useful way to look at classes and instances is to use sets: a class    
        describes a set of instances that share the same attributes and capabilities,    
        and instantiating from a set produces a member of that set.  From this    
        perspective, a class's superclass is a superset of that class, defined by    
        attributes and capabilities that are subsets of those of the class.  So: all    
        instances of a class are instances of all of its class's ancestors, and all    
        instances of a class share the attributes and capabilities of that class.  So    
        all but B are correct; B is incorrect because Crow is not an instance.
    - Crow is an instance of Bird    
      

      + Correct!
    - Russell has the capabilities and attributes of a Bird

    - All Bird attributes are shared by Russell and Howard
