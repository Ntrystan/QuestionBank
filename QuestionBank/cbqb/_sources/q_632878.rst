    We say indexing is fast if it's done in O(1) time, searching is fast if done    
    in O(lg N) time, and inserting and deleting are fast if done in O(1) time.    
    Compared to other data structures, sorted arrays offer:    
    

    - slow indexing, slow search, slow insertions and deletions.    
      

      - Sorted arrays can be indexed in constant time (which is fast), searched in    
        O(lg N) time (which is fast), and restructured in O(N) time (which is not as    
        good as O(1) time).
    - fast indexing, fast search, slow insertions and deletions.
