    Two algorithms accomplish the same task on a collection of N items. Algorithm    
    A performs (N/2)3 operations. Algorithm B performs N2 operations. Under what    
    conditions does algorithm A offer strictly better performance?    
    

    - N <= 7    
      

      + Correct!
    - N <= 8    
      

      - For N <= 7, (N/2)3 < N2.
    - N > 8    
      

      - For N <= 7, (N/2)3 < N2.
    - For all N    
      

      - For N <= 7, (N/2)3 < N2.
    - For no N    
      

      - For N <= 7, (N/2)3 < N2.
