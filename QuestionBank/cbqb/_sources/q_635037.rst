    A given O(n2) algorithm takes five seconds to execute on a data set size of    
        
        
    #. Using the same computer and the same algorithm, how many seconds should    
       this algorithm run for when executed on a data set of size 500?    
    

    - 25 seconds    
      

      - Quadratic algorithms represent an n2 increase in run time.  Hence if the data    
        set size increases by a factor of  five, for a quadratic algorithm, the    
        increase in run time becomes a factor of 25.  Hence 25 times 5 (base run time)    
        is 125.
    - 100 seconds

      + Correct!
    - None of the above.
