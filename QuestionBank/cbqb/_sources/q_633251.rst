    Consider the code    
        
    int i = 3;    
        
    int *p = &i;    
        
    Which of the following will print out "The value is 3."?    
    

    - printf("The value is %p", p);    
      

      - The value of p will be the memory address of i -- to dereference p, we need to    
        use *p.
    - printf("The value is %d", *p);    
      

      + Correct!
    - printf("The value is %d", &i);    
      

      - The value of p will be the memory address of i -- to dereference p, we need to    
        use *p.
    - printf("The value is %d", &p);    
      

      - The value of p will be the memory address of i -- to dereference p, we need to    
        use *p.
