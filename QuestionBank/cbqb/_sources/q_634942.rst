    What is the difference between    
        
    ``struct node* linked_list_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           linked_list_node->val = 3;    
           linked_list_node->next = NULL;    
        
    and:    
        
    ``struct node linked_list_node;``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           linked_list_node.val = 3;    
           linked_list_node.next = NULL;    
        
    ?    
    

    - The first needs more memory than the second    
      

      - Dynamic alloc goes on heap; static goes on stack.
    - The first's node is stored on the heap; the second's is stored on the stack    
      

      + Correct!
    - The second is globally-accessible in the program; the first is locally    
      accessible    
      

      - Dynamic alloc goes on heap; static goes on stack.
    - There is no difference    
      

      - Dynamic alloc goes on heap; static goes on stack.
