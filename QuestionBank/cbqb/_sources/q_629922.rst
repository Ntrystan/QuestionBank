    Consider the following Java interface:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public interface Mover {    
              public int getX();    
              public int getY();    
              public void setLocation(int x, int y);    
           }    
        
    Choose the best description of the following implementation of the Mover    
    interface:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class CartoonCharacter implements Mover{    
              public int getX;    
              public int getY;    
              public void setLocation;    
           }    
    

    - The implementation is correct, because it includes all the required methods    
      and their return types are correct.    
      

      - To implement a Java interface, a class must define all the methods required by    
        the interface (or declare itself abstract).

    - The implementation is incorrect, because it doesn't include the method    
      parameter types.

    - Both B and C.    
      

      + Correct!
