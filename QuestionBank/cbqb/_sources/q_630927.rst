    Using the information in the UML diagram above, suppose I have a method    
    (defined in some other class not on this diagram) with signature:    
        
    ``public void transportPeople(PeopleHauler mobile)``    
        
    which methods can be used with parameter mobile in this method?    
    

    - All of the methods of ``mobile``\ 's actual class    
      

      - Only the methods defined in the `interface PeopleMover` can be used,    
        independent of the actual type -- these are the only methods guaranteed to be    
        present, as all we know about the variable is that it is some class that    
        implements this `interface`
    - Only ``move()`` and ``carryCargo()``    
      

      - Only the methods defined in the `interface PeopleMover` can be used,    
        independent of the actual type -- these are the only methods guaranteed to be    
        present, as all we know about the variable is that it is some class that    
        implements this `interface`
    - Only ``move()`` and ``holdPeople(int)``    
      

      + Correct!
    - Only ``move(),`` carryCargo(), and ``holdPeople(int)``    
      

      - Only the methods defined in the `interface PeopleMover` can be used,    
        independent of the actual type -- these are the only methods guaranteed to be    
        present, as all we know about the variable is that it is some class that
