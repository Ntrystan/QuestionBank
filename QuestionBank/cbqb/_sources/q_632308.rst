    Suppose ``StackADT`` is implemented in Java using a linked list. The big-Oh time    
    complexity of the following ``peek`` method is:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public T peek() {     
              T tmp;    
              if (this.top == null) {    
                 tmp = null;     
              } else {    
                 tmp = this.top.getElement();     
              }     
              return tmp;     
           }    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(log n)    
      

      - The method body is executed in a fixed amount of time, independent of the size    
        of the stack.
    - O(n)    
      

      - The method body is executed in a fixed amount of time, independent of the size    
        of the stack.
    - O(n2)    
      

      - The method body is executed in a fixed amount of time, independent of the size    
        of the stack.
    - O(2n)    
      

      - The method body is executed in a fixed amount of time, independent of the size    
        of the stack.
