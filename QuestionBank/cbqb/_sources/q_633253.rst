    Which of the following lines of code will correctly read in the two floats x    
    and y?    
    

    - scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);    
      

      - Scanf requires pointers to x and y -- hence the ampersands. As x and y are    
        floats, %f is used for both.
    - scanf("&d&d", %x, %y);    
      

      - Scanf requires pointers to x and y -- hence the ampersands. As x and y are    
        floats, %f is used for both.
    - scanf("%f%f", &x, &y);    
      

      + Correct!
    - scanf("&f&f", %x, %y);    
      

      - Scanf requires pointers to x and y -- hence the ampersands. As x and y are    
        floats, %f is used for both.
