    After the following syntactically correct code is executed, where will Karel    
    be standing and which direction will the robot be facing? How many beepers    
    will karel be carrying? There are beepers at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5),    
    (2,6). (Note: a beeper at (2,5) means there is a beeper at the intersection of    
    2nd street and 5th avenue.)

    - Robot is facing East with five beepers and is located at (2,8)    
      

      + Correct!
    - Robot is facing East with five beepers and is located at (2,7)    
      

      - There is a final "move" after the loop terminates, moving the robot over one    
        block east (from (2,7) to (2,8)).
    - Robot is facing North with five beepers and is located at (8,2)    
      

      - There is a final "move" after the loop terminates, moving the robot over one    
        block east (from (2,7) to (2,8)).
    - Robot is facing East with one beeper and is located at (2,2)    
      

      - There is a final "move" after the loop terminates, moving the robot over one    
        block east (from (2,7) to (2,8)).
    - Robot is facing North with one beeper and is located at (2,2)    
      

      - There is a final "move" after the loop terminates, moving the robot over one    
        block east (from (2,7) to (2,8)).
