    What should be done to initialize *counter* to one in *main* method?    
        
    class C {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
         private int counter;    
        
        
    }    
        
    public class F {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
         public static void main(String arg[]){    
        
         }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - c.counter = 1;    
      

      - Change the definition of counter as follow:    
            
        private int counter = 1;
    - C c = new C();    
          
      c.counter = 1;    
      

      - Change the definition of counter as follow:    
            
        private int counter = 1;
    - C. add the following to C:    
          
      public void setCounter( int c){    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
           counter = c;    
          
          
      }    
          
      Add the following to F:    
          
      C c = new C();    
          
      c.setCounter(1);    
      

      + Correct!
    - Change the definition of counter as follow:    
          
      private int counter = 1;
