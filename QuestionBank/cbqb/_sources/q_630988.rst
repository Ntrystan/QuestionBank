    Consider the following code segment:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           if (!this.seesNet(LEFT) && this.seesFlower(AHEAD))    
           {    
               this.hop();    
               this.pick();    
           }    
           else    
           {    
               this.turn(RIGHT);    
           }    
        
    Which of the following alternative versions is logically equivalent to    
    (produce the same behavior as) the original?    
    

    - [code]    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         if (this.seesNet(LEFT) || this.seesFlower(AHEAD))    
         {    
             this.turn(RIGHT);    
         }    
         else    
         {    
             this.pick();    
             this.hop();    
         }    
          
          
      ```    
      

      - The correct alternative has the same actions in both branches of the if    
        statement, but in reversed positions--the true branch has moved to the false    
        branch, and vice versa.  At the same time, the logical condition in the if    
        statement is the opposite of the original condition (by applying De Morgan's    
        Law).  Together, these two conditions produce a behaviorally equivalent block    
        of code.

         {    
             this.turn(RIGHT);    
         }    
         else    
         {    
             this.hop();    
             this.pick();
