    Using the information in the UML diagram above, suppose an ``Oak`` prepares for    
    winter like a ``Tree``\ , but it drops its leaves first. What code should replace    
    ``???`` in the following code?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class Oak extends Tree {    
              ...    
              public void prepareForWinter(){    
                 this.dropLeaves();    
                 ???    
              }    
           }    
    

    - ``Tree.prepareForWinter();``    
      

      - To make an Oak prepare for winter "like a tree" after dropping its leaves,    
        you can simply have Oak invoke Tree's prepareForWinter method.    
            
        Alternative A would work if prepareForWinter were static, but that is not    
        indicated on this diagram (and would be really odd from a modeling    
        perspective).
    - ``super.this();``

      + Correct!
