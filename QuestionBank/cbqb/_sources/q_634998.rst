      - Ackermann's function is one of the earliest _hyper-exponential_ recursive    
        functions.  The key to obtaining the correct answer is in keeping which    
        parameter is which, straight.  Maybe, rename them as "red" and "blue" (instead    
        of n and m) to reduce confusion.
