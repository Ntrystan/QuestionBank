    What effect does the statement Option Explicit in the declaration section have    
    on a Visual Basic module?    
    

    - The programmer is given the option to save code before the program is run.    
      

      - "When Option Explicit appears in a file, you must explicitly declare all    
        variables using the Dim or ReDim statements. If you attempt to use an    
        undeclared variable name, an error occurs at compile time.    
            
        Use Option Explicit to avoid incorrectly typing the name of an existing    
        variable or to avoid confusion in code where the scope of the variable is not    
        clear. If you do not use the Option Explicit statement, all undeclared    
        variables are of Object type".

    - All variables in the module have to be declared before use.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Global variables may be declared in the declarations section.
