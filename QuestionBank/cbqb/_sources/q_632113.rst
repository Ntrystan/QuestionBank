    I have a data control, dtData, and several text boxes which are bound to it.    
    The program user edits some of the text in one of the boxes, but makes a    
    mistake and presses the Cancel button to undo the changes. What code should    
    the Cancel button invoke?    
    

    - dtData.Recordset.Update    
      

      - This method applies the cancel event procedure to restore the display content    
        of the text boxes associated with the Data control without affecting the    
        underlying recordset.
    - dtData.Recordset.Delete    
      

      - This method applies the cancel event procedure to restore the display content    
        of the text boxes associated with the Data control without affecting the    
        underlying recordset.
    - dtData.UpdateControls    
      

      + Correct!
    - dtData.UpdateRecord    
      

      - This method applies the cancel event procedure to restore the display content    
        of the text boxes associated with the Data control without affecting the    
        underlying recordset.
    - dtData.Clear    
      

      - This method applies the cancel event procedure to restore the display content    
        of the text boxes associated with the Data control without affecting the    
        underlying recordset.
