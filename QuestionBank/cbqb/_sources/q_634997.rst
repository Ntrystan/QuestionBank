    Assume M and N are positive integers. What does the following code print?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int sum=0;    
           for (int j=0; j<M; j++) {    
             for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {    
               if (N%2==0) {    
                 sum += 1;    
               }    
             }    
           }    
           System.out.println(sum);    
    

    - M    
      

      - The outer loop executes M times, while the inner loop executes N/2 times (i.e.    
        if N is 6, the loop executes 3 times because there are 3 even numbers (0,2,4)    
        between 0 and 5).
    - MN    
      

      - The outer loop executes M times, while the inner loop executes N/2 times (i.e.    
        if N is 6, the loop executes 3 times because there are 3 even numbers (0,2,4)    
        between 0 and 5).
    - M*N    
      

      - The outer loop executes M times, while the inner loop executes N/2 times (i.e.    
        if N is 6, the loop executes 3 times because there are 3 even numbers (0,2,4)    
        between 0 and 5).
    - M*N/2    
      

      + Correct!
    - M*(N/2+1)    
      

      - The outer loop executes M times, while the inner loop executes N/2 times (i.e.    
        if N is 6, the loop executes 3 times because there are 3 even numbers (0,2,4)    
        between 0 and 5).
