    Yuchi has the following code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           #DEFINE N 500    
           ---- (other code skipped) ----    
           int arr[N][N]; int i; int j;    
           for(i = 0; i < N; i++)    
           {    
               for(j = 0; j < N; j++)    
               {    
                   arr[i][j] = i + j;    
               }    
           }    
        
    When he changes N to 500,000, his code crashes. Why?    
    

    - There is a memory leak in the code    
      

      - arr is stored on the stack as it was statically allocated; the stack has    
        limited space.
    - ``arr`` is on the stack; it has run out of stack space    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``arr`` is on the heap; it has run out of heap space    
      

      - arr is stored on the stack as it was statically allocated; the stack has    
        limited space.
    - With N that large, there will be at least one integer overflow in the code    
      

      - arr is stored on the stack as it was statically allocated; the stack has    
        limited space.
