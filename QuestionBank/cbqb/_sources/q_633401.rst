    You see the expression ``n = -15`` in some code that successfully compiles. What    
    type can ``n`` not be?    
    

    - int    
      

      - Chars can only hold integers in [0, 65535]. Assigning an int variable to a    
        char requires an explicit cast. Assigning an int literal in this interval does    
        not require a cast. Assign an int literal outside of this interval is compile    
        error.
    - float

    - char    
      

      + Correct!
