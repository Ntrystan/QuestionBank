    Suppose you are defining a Java ``ProductItem`` class to store information about    
    the inventory in a store, and you want to give the class an instance variable    
    for the price of that item. Which of the following is the best datatype for    
    the instance variable that models the price?    
    

    - ``double``    
      

      - Arguments can be made for any of these choices (except perhaps "int"). I would    
        give `Money` an edge, because a user-defined class allows you to write methods    
        to display the value properly, do arithmetic on it, and perhaps convert it to    
        different currencies. But I'm going to tag this as a question with more than    
        one answer.
    - ``float``

    - a user-defined ``Money`` class    
      

      + Correct!
