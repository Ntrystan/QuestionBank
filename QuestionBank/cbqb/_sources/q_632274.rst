    Which data structure uses less space per object?    
    

    - an array    
      

      + Correct!
    - a linked list    
      

      - In a linked list, you create a Node for each element that contains not only    
        the element but a link to the next Node. In addition, you create a List object    
        that contains additional fields such as a link to the first Node in the list    
        and (often) the size of the list. In an array, you store only the elements,    
        not a Node or a link to the next Node.
    - they are both the same
