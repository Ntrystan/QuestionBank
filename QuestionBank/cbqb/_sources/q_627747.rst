    For the purposes of this question, two code fragments are considered to be    
    equivalent if, when they are run using the same input, they always produce the    
    same output. Which line could be removed from the following code fragment so    
    that the resulting code fragment is equivalent to the original one?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           1.  Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in);    
           2.  int x, product;    
           3.  x = -1;    
           4.  product = 1;    
           5.  x = kbd.nextInt();    
           6.  while (x >= 0) {    
           7.    if (x > 0) {    
           8.       product *= x;    
           9.    }    
           10.   x = kbd.nextInt();    
           11. }    
           12. System.out.println(product);    
    

    - Line 3    
      

      + Correct!
    - Line 4    
      

      - Line 3 can be removed because x is initialized again in line 5, before it is    
        ever used.
    - Line 5    
      

      - Line 3 can be removed because x is initialized again in line 5, before it is    
        ever used.
    - Line 8    
      

      - Line 3 can be removed because x is initialized again in line 5, before it is    
        ever used.
    - Line 10    
      

      - Line 3 can be removed because x is initialized again in line 5, before it is    
        ever used.
