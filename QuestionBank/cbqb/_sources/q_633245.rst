    Two algorithms accomplish the same task on a collection of N items. Algorithm    
    A performs N2 operations. Algorithm B performs 10N operations. Under what    
    conditions does algorithm A offer better performance?    
    

    - N < 10    
      

      + Correct!
    - N < 100    
      

      - The two algorithms offer equal performance when N = 10. For N greater than 10,    
        N2 > 10N.
    - N > 10    
      

      - The two algorithms offer equal performance when N = 10. For N greater than 10,    
        N2 > 10N.
    - For all N.    
      

      - The two algorithms offer equal performance when N = 10. For N greater than 10,    
        N2 > 10N.
    - For no N.    
      

      - The two algorithms offer equal performance when N = 10. For N greater than 10,    
        N2 > 10N.
