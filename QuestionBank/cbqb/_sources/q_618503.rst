    If we know the length of the string used in our program is almost 200, is    
    there any difference between these following definitions in terms of    
    performance?    
        
    StringBuilder string1 = new StringBuilder();    
        
    StringBuilder string2 = new StringBuilder(50);    
        
    StringBuilder string3 = new StringBuilder(100);    
    

    - No, there is no performance difference.    
      

      - Yes, the definition of string2 is better.
    - Yes, the definition of string1 is better.    
      

      - Yes, the definition of string2 is better.
    - Yes, the definition of string2 is better.    
      

      - Yes, the definition of string2 is better.
    - Yes, the definition of String3 is better.    
      

      + Correct!
