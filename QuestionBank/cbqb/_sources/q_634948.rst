    When we use recursion to solve a problem, we have    
        
        
    #. a problem that contains one or more problems that are similar to itself    
    #. a version of the problem that is simple enough to be solved by itself, without recursion, and    
    #. a way of making the the problem simpler so that it is closer to (and ultimately the same as) the version in 2.    
        
    What is 2. called?    
    

    - The simple case    
      

      - Base case is the term we use for the case that is simple enough to solve    
        directly.   We probably lifted the term from induction proofs in Mathematics,    
        which is fitting.
    - The inductive case

      + Correct!
    - The iterative case

    - None of the above
