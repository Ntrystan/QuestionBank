    Which command will tell gcc to optimize recursion so that any code that has    
    been executed will not be executed again? (e.g. fibo(3) will only be    
    calculated once.)    
    

    - gcc fibonacci.c -03    
      

      + Correct!
    - gcc fibonacci.c -o    
      

      - Optimization level 3 is what is needed to avoid redundant recursive calls.
    - gcc fibonacci.c --optimize    
      

      - Optimization level 3 is what is needed to avoid redundant recursive calls.
    - gcc fibonacci.c -g    
      

      - Optimization level 3 is what is needed to avoid redundant recursive calls.
