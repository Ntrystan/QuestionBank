    How many times will the printf statement be executed in this code?    
        
    In each case assume the definition    
        
    int i = 0;    
        
    WARNING There are some very nasty traps in some of the code here. LOOK AT IT    
    ALL VERY CAREFULLY!    
        
     do    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        printf("Count me!");    
        
        i++;    
        
        
    } while(++i < 10);    
    

    - 0    
      

      - The line i++; in the body of the loop after the printf function, in    
        combination with the ++i preceding each iteration in the while loop, causes    
        the index to increment twice in each iteration, so the printf function is only    
        executed 5 times
    - 5    
      

      + Correct!
    - 6
