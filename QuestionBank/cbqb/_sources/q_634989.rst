    Anastasiya has written code that loops over an int array named ``a`` which is of    
    length N. Fill in the missing parts of the for loop's declaration.    
        
    ``int sum = 0;``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int *p;    
           for(p = a;  ; ) // complete this line    
           {    
               sum += *p;    
           }    
    

    - p < N; p++    
      

      - p will not work as the ending condition as you don't know what's at the end of    
        the array; N is not an appropriate ending condition as it needs to be relative    
        from where you started. D and E are wrong as those would be for linked lists.
    - p; p++    
      

      - p will not work as the ending condition as you don't know what's at the end of    
        the array; N is not an appropriate ending condition as it needs to be relative    
        from where you started. D and E are wrong as those would be for linked lists.
    - p < a + N; p++    
      

      + Correct!
    - p; p = p->next    
      

      - p will not work as the ending condition as you don't know what's at the end of    
        the array; N is not an appropriate ending condition as it needs to be relative    
        from where you started. D and E are wrong as those would be for linked lists.
    - p->next; p = p->next    
      

      - p will not work as the ending condition as you don't know what's at the end of    
        the array; N is not an appropriate ending condition as it needs to be relative    
        from where you started. D and E are wrong as those would be for linked lists.
