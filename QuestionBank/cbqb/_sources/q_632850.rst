    What does this print when x is assigned 1?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           if (x==1) {    
              System.out.println("x is 1");    
           } if (x==2) {    
              System.out.println("x is 2");    
           } else {    
              System.out.println("not 1 or 2");    
           }    
    

    - x is 1    
      

      - This code snipped does not have an else-if!  It may as well be written like    
        this:    
            
        [code]    
            
            if (x==1) {    
               System.out.println("x is 1");    
            }    
                
            if (x==2) {    
               System.out.println("x is 2");    
            } else {    
               System.out.println("not 1 or 2");    
            }    
                
        [/code]    
            
            
            
        So when x==1, clearly we get "x is 1" printed, bu since 1 does not equal 2, we    
        also get "not 1 or 2" with the else.    
            
        Be aware of when you are using an if, and when are are using an else-if,    
        because they are quite different!
    - x is 2

    - x is 1    
          
      not 1 or 2    
      

      + Correct!
    - x is 2    
          
      not 1 or 2
