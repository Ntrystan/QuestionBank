    Consider the following code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
              public int examMethod(int n) {    
                 if (n == 1) return 1;    
                 else if (n > 1) return (n + this.examMethod(n-1));    
              }    
        
    What is the purpose of ``examMethod``\ ?    
    

    - to compute fibonacci(n)    
      

      - The method returns 1 if n is 1, 2+1 if n is 2, 3+2+1 if n is 3, etc. In other    
        words, it computes the sum of the integers from 1 to n (answer C).
    - to compute factorial(n)    
      

      - The method returns 1 if n is 1, 2+1 if n is 2, 3+2+1 if n is 3, etc. In other    
        words, it computes the sum of the integers from 1 to n (answer C).
    - to compute the sum of the positive integers from 1 to n    
      

      + Correct!
    - none of the above    
      

      - The method returns 1 if n is 1, 2+1 if n is 2, 3+2+1 if n is 3, etc. In other    
        words, it computes the sum of the integers from 1 to n (answer C).
