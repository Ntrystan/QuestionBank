    This sorting algorithm roughly orders elements about a pivot element and then    
    sorts the subarray of elements less than the pivot and the subarray of    
    elements greater than the pivot.    
    

    - selection sort    
      

      - Quick sort puts all elements less than the pivot element before the pivot and    
        all elements greater after the pivot. Then it sorts these two halves.
    - insertion sort    
      

      - Quick sort puts all elements less than the pivot element before the pivot and    
        all elements greater after the pivot. Then it sorts these two halves.
    - bubble sort    
      

      - Quick sort puts all elements less than the pivot element before the pivot and    
        all elements greater after the pivot. Then it sorts these two halves.
    - quick sort    
      

      + Correct!
    - merge sort    
      

      - Quick sort puts all elements less than the pivot element before the pivot and    
        all elements greater after the pivot. Then it sorts these two halves.
