       Which of the following statements is true, after executing the following code    
        
       (assuming Ball has a constructor that takes a Color argument).    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
       BallPanel myPanel = new BallPanel(5);    
       myPanel.getMoreBalls()[0] = new Ball(java.awt.Color.pink);    
        
        
    ```    
        
    ?    
    

    - The array\ ``_balls`` in myPanel is unchanged    
      

      - Because of line 9, both _balls and _moreBalls refer to the same array.    
        Therefore, if I re-assign an element in one array, the change shows up under    
        the other.  Moreover, since it is really only one array the elements are    
        identical, so == will be true in this case.
    - The array _moreBalls in myPanel is unchanged    
      

      - Because of line 9, both _balls and _moreBalls refer to the same array.    
        Therefore, if I re-assign an element in one array, the change shows up under    
        the other.  Moreover, since it is really only one array the elements are    
        identical, so == will be true in this case.
    - The first element of ``_moreBalls`` in myPanel is a new ``Ball`` constructed using    
      ``new Ball(java.awt.Color.pink);`` and is not the same as the first element of    
      ``_balls`` in myPanel;\ ``    
      ``    
      

      - Because of line 9, both _balls and _moreBalls refer to the same array.    
        Therefore, if I re-assign an element in one array, the change shows up under

    - ``myPanel.getBalls()[0] == myPanel.getMoreBalls()[0]``    
      

      + Correct!
    - The code will not execute because the second line has a syntax error.
