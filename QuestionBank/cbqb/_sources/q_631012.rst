    Consider the incomplete code segment below. The segment is supposed to    
    initialize a 4 x 4 matrix as shown in this image:

           int matrix[][] = new int[SIZE][SIZE];  // line 1    
           for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)         // line 2

    Select statement from the choices below that is the best choice to fill in the    
    blank on ``line 6`` of this code segment so that it behaves as desired.    
    

    - ``i == j - 1``    
      

      - The condition on line 6 controls which locations in the array are set to the    
        value 1.  The 1's in the array should appear along the identity diagonal,    
        where i and j have the same value.
    - ``i == j``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``i == j + 1``    
      

      - The condition on line 6 controls which locations in the array are set to the    
        value 1.  The 1's in the array should appear along the identity diagonal,    
        where i and j have the same value.
    - ``Math.abs(i - j) == 1``    
      

      - The condition on line 6 controls which locations in the array are set to the    
        value 1.  The 1's in the array should appear along the identity diagonal,    
        where i and j have the same value.
    - None of these    
      

      - The condition on line 6 controls which locations in the array are set to the    
        value 1.  The 1's in the array should appear along the identity diagonal,
