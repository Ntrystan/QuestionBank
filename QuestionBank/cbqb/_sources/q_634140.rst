    Consider the code    
        
    ``int *p, *q, i;``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           i = 3;    
           q = p;    
           q = &i;    
           printf("The value of p is %d which points to %d.\n", p, *p);    
        
    Which of the following would you expect the program to print?    
    

    - The value of p is 0x3eee198e1e1 which points to 3.    
      

      - p was never assigned! While p and q are sharing for a while that does not mean    
        they are the same.
    - The value of p is 0 which points to 0.    
      

      - p was never assigned! While p and q are sharing for a while that does not mean    
        they are the same.
    - The value of p is -29389112111 which points to 3.    
      

      - p was never assigned! While p and q are sharing for a while that does not mean    
        they are the same.
    - Segmentation fault    
      

      + Correct!
