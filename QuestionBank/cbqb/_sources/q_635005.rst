    Which algorithm is most arguably a greedy algorithm? (Circle the best answer.)    
    

    - merge sort    
      

      - Selection sort greedily takes the min/max of the array. This is a clicker    
        question to discuss what greedy means; none of the algorithms are really    
        greedy!
    - insertion sort    
      

      - Selection sort greedily takes the min/max of the array. This is a clicker

        greedy!
    - selection sort    
      

      + Correct!
    - bubble sort
