    Martina has created an array, arr[50], and she has written the following line    
    of code:\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    *(arr + 20) = 6;\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    Rewrite this line to use the [ ] notation for arrays.    
    

    - arr[21] = 6    
      

      - arr[20] == *(arr + 20)
    - *arr[20] = 6    
      

      - arr[20] == *(arr + 20)
    - arr[20] = 6    
      

      + Correct!
    - *arr[21] = 6    
      

      - arr[20] == *(arr + 20)
