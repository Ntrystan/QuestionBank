    Malik is using quicksort. He has the list [3, 4, 5, 1, 0] and will be pivoting    
    around the element 3. After partitioning, what will the list look like?    
    

    - [3, 4, 5, 0, 1]    
      

      - In the implementation of quicksort we used in class, all elements before the    
        pivot are moved before the pivot; all elements after the pivot are moved after    
        it.
    - [1, 0, 3, 4, 5]    
      

      + Correct!
    - [3, 1, 0, 4, 5]
