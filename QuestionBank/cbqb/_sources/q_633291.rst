    Inserting a node into a heap is    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - Inserting a node involves putting the new node into the bottom level of the    
        heap and trickling up, possibly to the root level. Since heaps are balanced    
        and the number of levels is log N, the performance is O(log N).
    - O(log N)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(N)

    - O(N log N)
