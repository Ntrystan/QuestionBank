    What is output by the code shown in the question below. Think aboutit    
    carefully - it may be a bit tricky!    
        
    void main(void)    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        static int aiTable[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};    
        
        int i;    
        
        for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)    
        
        {    
        
             if( !(aiTable[i] % 2))    
        
                  printf("%d", aiTable[i]);

      - Modulus is the remainder of integer division of two numbers with the result    
        placed somewhere.    
            
        The modulus function of a and b, a being the dividend and b being the divisor,    
        is a - int(a/b) * b.    
            
        For example, using integer results...    
            
        47/4 = 11      
        47%4 = 3    
            
        Check it: 47 = 11*4 + 3

        In this case the negatively phrased line of code "if( !(aiTable[i] % 2))" is    
        an alternative way of  expressing the more common phrasing of a modulus    
        arithmetic expression as given below    
            
        If you wanted to know if a number was odd or even, you could use modulus to    
        quickly tell you by asking for the remainder of the number when divided by 2.    
            
        #include <iostream>    
            
        using namespace std;    
            
        int main()    
            
        {    
            
              int num;    
            
             cin >> num;    
            
             // num % 2 computes the remainder when num is divided by 2    
            
             if ( num % 2 == 0 )    
            
             {    
            
                   cout << num << " is even ";    
            
             }    
            
        return 0;    
            
        }    
            
        The key line is the one that performs the modulus operation: "num % 2 == 0". A    
        number is even if and only if it is divisible by two, and a number is    
        divisible by another only if there is no remainder.
