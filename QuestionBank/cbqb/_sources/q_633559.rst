    You've got two classes, Key and Value, both of which descend from Object. You    
    intend to use these classes to populate a hashtable. Which class needs the    
    hashCode method and which needs the equals method?    
    

    - Key.hashCode, Value.equals    
      

      - Only the Key needs these methods. On a search, only the Key will be provided,    
        so that alone must provide the necessary information for finding the    
        corresponding Value. Object's implementation of the equals method is too    
        restrictive, comparing Keys only for identity.
    - Key.hashCode, Key.equals    
      

      + Correct!
    - Value.hashCode, Object.equals    
      

      - Only the Key needs these methods. On a search, only the Key will be provided,    
        so that alone must provide the necessary information for finding the    
        corresponding Value. Object's implementation of the equals method is too    
        restrictive, comparing Keys only for identity.
    - Key.hashCode, Object.equals    
      

      - Only the Key needs these methods. On a search, only the Key will be provided,    
        so that alone must provide the necessary information for finding the    
        corresponding Value. Object's implementation of the equals method is too    
        restrictive, comparing Keys only for identity.
    - Value.hashCode, Value.equals
