    Yuchi and Rui are working on a problem: to create an array whose elements are    
    the sum of the row and\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    column indices. (For example, arr[2][3] = 5, as does arr[3][2].) They're both    
    working off the same server\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    using the same compiler settings.    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           // Yuchi's Code    
           #DEFINE N 500    
           ---- (other code skipped) ----    
           int arr[N][N]; int i; int j;    
           for(i = 0; i < N; i++)    
           {    
              for(j = 0; j < N; j++)    
              {    
                  arr[i][j] = i + j;    
              }    
           }    
        
           // Rui's Code    
           #DEFINE N 500    
           ---- (other code skipped) ----    
           int arr[N][N]; int i; int j;    
           for(i = 0; i < N; i++)    
           {    
               for(j = 0; j < N; j++)    
               {    
                   arr[j][i] = i + j;    
               }    
           }    
        
    Whose code will be faster?    
    

    - Yuchi's code    
      

      + Correct!
    - Rui's code    
      

      - Yuchi's code will be slightly faster as C uses row-major order array storage.
    - The two are identical    
      

      - Yuchi's code will be slightly faster as C uses row-major order array storage.
