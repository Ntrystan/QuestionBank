    Consider the following class for a Ninja:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class Ninja {    
             private int honor;    
             public Ninja(int h) {    
               this.honor=h;    
             }    
           }    
        
    Suppose we instantiate two Ninjas like this:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           Ninja n1=new Ninja(50);    
           Ninja n2=new Ninja(50);    
        
    Is the following statement True, False, or It Depends (i.e. depends on a    
    factor external to this question)    
        
    n1.equals(n2)    
    

    - True    
      

      - The equals() method has not been overloaded, so it's using the default    
        implementation of equals() in Java, which falls back on ==.    
            
        This is sort of a trick question, but it's a reasonably common error pattern    
        in CS-2.
    - False    
      

      + Correct!
    - It depends    
          
      (Be ready to discuss what it depends on when we get to the discussion phase of    
      this question)
