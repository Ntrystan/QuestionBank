    Suppose you are trying to choose between an array and a singly linked list to    
    store the data in your Java program. Which arguments would correctly support    
    one side or the other?    
    

    - Linked lists are better suited to a program where the amount of data can    
      change unpredictably.    
      

      - Array elements can be accessed in constant time, but access to an element of a    
        linked list is O(n), so B is correct and C is incorrect. A is also correct,    
        because arrays require you to guess how much memory will be needed and set    
        aside a fixed amount, while linked lists use memory as needed for the data    
        that are being stored. Since A and B are correct and C is not, the answer is    
        D.
    - Arrays provide more efficient access to individual elements.

    - A and B only    
      

      + Correct!
