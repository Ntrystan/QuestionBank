    After the assignment ``signal = 'abracadabra'``\ , what is returned by    
    ``signal[-1:]``\ ?    
    

    - 'a'    
      

      + Correct!
    - 'abracadabra'    
      

      - Python actually allows negative indexes, which start counting from the back of    
        a list or String.  However, the slice operation by default still only uses    
        increasing indexes.  So, slicing [-1:] means to slice from the last character    
        through the rest of the String (slice operations that leave out the upper    
        boundary implicitly mean "slice to the end").
    - ''

    - none of the above
