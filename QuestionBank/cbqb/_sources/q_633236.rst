    This code fails to compile:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           char current = 'a';    
           current = current + 1;    
        
    Why?    
    

    - We can't add ints and chars.    
      

      - The char is promoted to an int when an int is added to it. Thus, our right-    
        hand side is an int while our left-hand side is a char. Assigning an int into    
        a char may result in information less, which requires us to sign off on this    
        risky operation with an explicit cast.
    - We're trying to squeeze an int into a char.    
      

      + Correct!
    - The character after 'a' is platform-dependent.    
      

      - The char is promoted to an int when an int is added to it. Thus, our right-    
        hand side is an int while our left-hand side is a char. Assigning an int into    
        a char may result in information less, which requires us to sign off on this    
        risky operation with an explicit cast.

      - The char is promoted to an int when an int is added to it. Thus, our right-    
        hand side is an int while our left-hand side is a char. Assigning an int into

        risky operation with an explicit cast.
    - The assignment is infinitely recursive.
