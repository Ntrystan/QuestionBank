    What is most likely to happen?    
    

    - Deletes a copy of root (will not have an effect outside the function)    
      

      - This will free what root is pointing to; it is a pesumably valid memory    
        location and hence won't segfault or core dump.
    - Segfault    
      

      - This will free what root is pointing to; it is a pesumably valid memory    
        location and hence won't segfault or core dump.
    - Deletes the argument given to the function (will have an effect outside the    
      function)    
      

      + Correct!
    - A lot of crazy stuff will be printed    
      

      - This will free what root is pointing to; it is a pesumably valid memory    
        location and hence won't segfault or core dump.
