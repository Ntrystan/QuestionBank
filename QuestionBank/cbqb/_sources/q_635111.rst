    Determine if Java would evaluate the following boolean expression as true or    
    false, or if there is something (syntactically) wrong with the expression:    
        
    ``(!x && !y) && (y && z)``    
    

    - true    
      

      - Consider the value of variable `y`, which appears in the expression twice.  If    
        `y` is false, the right subexpression must also be false, so the overall    
        expression will be false, because of the semantics of `&&`. Alternatively, if    
        `y` is true, the left subexpression must be false because of its inclusion of    
        `!y`, which also causes the overall expression to be false.` `
    - false    
      

      + Correct!
    - syntax error
