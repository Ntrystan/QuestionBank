    Which of the following code fragments is equivalent to the version above?    
    "Equivalent" means that both fragments would assign the same values to ``a`` and    
    ``d``\ , given the same values for ``b`` and ``c``.    
    

    - [code]    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         int a = 1;    
         int d = 7;    
         if (b < c)    
         {    
             d = a * 2;    
         }    
         else    
         {    
              a = 2;    
         }    
          
          
      ```    
      

      - The opposite condition of `(b > c)` is `(b <= c)`.  The correct answer has    
        this opposite if test, and the two actions in the branches of the if statement    
        in opposite positions.
