    Suppose you have a ``List`` of seven ``Integer`` values called ``test`` containing    
    the following data:    
        
        
    .. image:: img/27.png    
       :target: img/27.png    
       :alt: no description    
        
        
    Trace the execution of the following code (remember that Java will    
    automatically convert between primitive ``int`` values and ``Integer`` wrapper    
    objects where needed):    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int x = 0;    
           int y = 0;    
           for (int i = 0; i < test.size(); i++)    
           {    
               if (test.get(i) % 6 == 0)    
               {    
                   x++;    
                   y += i;    
               }    
           }    
        
    What is the value of ``x`` when this loop is done?    
    

    - 0    
      

      - The variable `x` is incremented for each value in the array that is evenly    
        divisible by 6, so the final value of `x` after the loop is 5.
    - 3    
      

      - The variable `x` is incremented for each value in the array that is evenly    
        divisible by 6, so the final value of `x` after the loop is 5.
    - 4

    - 5    
      

      + Correct!

      - The variable `x` is incremented for each value in the array that is evenly    
        divisible by 6, so the final value of `x` after the loop is 5.
