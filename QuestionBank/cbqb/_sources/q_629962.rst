    Suppose you have a Java array of ints. What is the worst-case time complexity    
    of retrieving a value from a given location in the array?    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(log n)    
      

      - Retrieving a value from an array can be done in constant time.
    - O(n)    
      

      - Retrieving a value from an array can be done in constant time.
    - O(n log n)    
      

      - Retrieving a value from an array can be done in constant time.
    - O(n2)    
      

      - Retrieving a value from an array can be done in constant time.
