    Given the declaration    
        
    **Public StudentRecords as Collection**    
        
    What line of code is required before the first student record is added to the    
    collection?    
    

    - StudentRecords = New Collection    
      

      - Set assigns an object reference to the new Collection object named    
        StudentRecords
    - Set StudentRecords = Collection    
      

      - Set assigns an object reference to the new Collection object named    
        StudentRecords
    - Set StudentRecords = New Collection

        StudentRecords
