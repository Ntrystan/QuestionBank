    After the assignments ``x = 27`` and ``y = 12``\ , what is returned by ``not x <= y <    
    x + y`` ?    
    

    - True    
      

      - Python has an incredibly flexible syntax which allows expressions like x <= y    
        < x + y (this statement would not compile in many other languages).    
            
        If we break this expression down:    
            
        x+y is 39, so the expression is asking:    
            
        not 12 <= 27 < 39    
            
        12 <= 27 < 39 is True, as 27 is in fact between 12 and 39.  And if we apply    
        not to True, we get False.
    - False    
      

      + Correct!
