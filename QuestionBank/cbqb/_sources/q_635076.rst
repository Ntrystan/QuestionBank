    Consider these two Java methods:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public void fuzzy(int x)    
           {    
               x = 73;    
               System.out.print(x + " ");    
           }    
        
           public void bunny()    
           {    
               int x = 29;    
               fuzzy(x);    
               System.out.println(x);    
           }    
        
    What is printed when ``bunny()`` is called?

      - Remember that in Java, parameters are passed by value.  Although a method may    
        assign to a parameter, this change only affects the method's local copy of the    
        parameter and is not visible outside the method (i.e., does not affect the    
        actual value passed in by the caller).
