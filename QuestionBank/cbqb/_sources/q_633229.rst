    What is printed when the following program runs?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class Main {    
             public static boolean getTrue() {    
               System.out.print("T");    
               return true;    
             }    
        
             public static boolean getFalse() {    
               System.out.print("F");    
               return false;    
             }    
        
             public static void main(String[] args) {    
               getFalse() || getTrue();    
             }    
           }

      - || guarantees left-to-right evaluation, stopping at the first operand that is    
        true.
    - T    
      

      - || guarantees left-to-right evaluation, stopping at the first operand that is
