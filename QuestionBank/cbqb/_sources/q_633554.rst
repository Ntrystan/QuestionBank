    What terminates a failed linear probe in a full hashtable?    
    

    - The end of the array    
      

      - A null entry will not appear in a full hashtable. Seeing the end of the array    
        isn't correct, since we need to examine all elements, including those that    
        appear before our original hash index. A node with a non-matching key is what    
        started our probe in the first place. The purpose of leaving a deleted node in    
        the table is so that probing may proceed past it. Revisiting the original hash    
        index means we've looked at every entry and determined the item doesn't appear    
        in the table.

      + Correct!
