    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    if x >= 0:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
       print 1    
        
        
    elif x < 20:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
       print 2    
        
        
    else:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
       print 3    
        
        
    print 4    
        
    For what values of x will 4 be among the values printed?    
    

    - x < 0    
      

      - The statement that prints 4 is NOT part of the if expression; thus it will be    
        preinted regardless of what happens with the loop
    - x >= 0    
      

      - The statement that prints 4 is NOT part of the if expression; thus it will be    
        preinted regardless of what happens with the loop
    - x >= 20    
      

      - The statement that prints 4 is NOT part of the if expression; thus it will be    
        preinted regardless of what happens with the loop
    - All values of x    
      

      + Correct!
    - None of the above    
      

      - The statement that prints 4 is NOT part of the if expression; thus it will be    
        preinted regardless of what happens with the loop
