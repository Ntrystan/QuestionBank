    What is output by the code shown in the question below. Think about it    
    carefully - it may be a bit tricky!    
        
    void main (void)    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        #define LIMIT 8    
        
        int i = 0;    
        
        while ( i++ < LIMIT )    
        
       {    
        
             if ( i )    
        
            {    
        
                  printf( "%d", LIMIT - i );    
        
            }    
        
        }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - Nothing    
      

      - The while loop increments the index before each iteration of the loop and the    
        resulting increased index value is subtracted from the Limit of 8.  Thus the    
        values printed range from 7 to 0.
    - 876543210

      + Correct!
