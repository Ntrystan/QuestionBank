    What advantage does using dummy nodes in a linked list implementation offer?    
    

    - Reduced storage needs.    
      

      - Dummy nodes consume a little more space, and they don't simplify iteration or    
        bounds detection any. They do reduce the special casing that would otherwise    
        need to be done when updating forward and backward links on an insertion.
    - Simplified insertion.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Easier detection of the list's head and tail.
