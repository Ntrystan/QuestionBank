    Consider the following recursive method:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public int examMethod(int n) {    
              if (n == 1) return 1;    
              else return (n + this.examMethod(n-1));    
           }    
        
    What value is returned by the call ``examMethod(16)``\ ?    
    

    - 1    
      

      - This method returns the sum of the numbers from 1 to the parameter n (as long    
        as n is greater than or equal to 1).
    - 16    
      

      - This method returns the sum of the numbers from 1 to the parameter n (as long    
        as n is greater than or equal to 1).
    - 136    
      

      + Correct!
    - None of the above.    
      

      - This method returns the sum of the numbers from 1 to the parameter n (as long    
        as n is greater than or equal to 1).
