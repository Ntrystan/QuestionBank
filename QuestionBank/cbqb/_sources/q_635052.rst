    What output will the following code fragment produce?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public void fn()    
           {    
               int grade = 91;    
               int level = -3;    
               if (grade >= 90)    
                   if (level <= -2)    
                       System.out.println("A-level");    
               else    
                   System.out.println("B-status");    
           }    
    

    - A-level    
      

      + Correct!
    - B-status    
      

      - Despite the indentation, no braces appear around the body of either if    
        statement's branch(es).  As a result, the else is associated with the second    
        (inner) if.  Still, both if statement conditions are true, so the output is    
        `A-level`.
    - "A-level"
