    Given the above binary tree rooted at Node A, what is the order of nodes    
    visited by a postorder search?    
    

    - A, B, C, D, E, F, G    
      

      - A postorder search of a tree is: visit the left subtree, visit the right    
        subtree, visit the root    
            
        It procedes as    
            
        Visit left subtree:    
            
             Visit its left subtree:    
            
                  Visit D    
            
             Visit its right subtree:    
            
                  Visit E    
            
             Visit B (its root)    
            
        Visit right subtree:    
            
             Visit its left subtree:    
            
                  Visit F    
            
             Visit its right subtree:    
            
                  Visit G    
            
             Visit C (its root)    
            
        Visit A (the root)    
            
        The order of nodes visited corresponds to answer D
    - A, B, D, E, C, F, G
