    Suppose we have an arbitrary number of entries that each includes a key and a    
    value. We never need to search the entries while the rule for insertion and    
    removal is first-in-last-out. Which data structure is proper?    
    

    - one dimensional array    
      

      - single linked list
    - two dimensional array    
      

      - single linked list
    - single linked list    
      

      + Correct!
    - double linked list    
      

      - single linked list
