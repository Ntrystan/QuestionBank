    True or False:    
        
    You should *always* catch checked exceptions!    
    

    - True    
      

      - This is definitely False!  Consider this code:    
            
        [code]    
            
            String s="";    
            try {    
              BufferedReader r=new BufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.txt"));    
              // read file and concatenate onto s    
            } catch (IOException e) {    
              System.out.println("Can't read file");    
            }    
                
        [/code]    
            
            
            
        Why are we catching this exception?  We are not doing anything useful with it.    
        What happens when there is an exception?  The program prints an error, but    
        continues with an empty String s.  That's probably wrong and it makes like the    
        file contained an empty String, which may be an illegal input.  What if this    
        code is being use by a web service and there is not someone monitoring the    
        printing.  What if it's running where System.out is not being captured?    
            
        It would be better if this code just crashed.
    - False    
      

      + Correct!
