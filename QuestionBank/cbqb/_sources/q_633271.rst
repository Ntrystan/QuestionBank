    Kejun has the executable add that adds three command-line args together and    
    prints the\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    result. He runs it like so:\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    ``./add 25 10 5``    
        
    ``the sum is 40``    
        
    In his code, what is the value of argc?    
    

    - 0    
      

      - ./add is considered a command-line argument
    - 1    
      

      - ./add is considered a command-line argument
    - 2    
      

      - ./add is considered a command-line argument
    - 3    
      

      - ./add is considered a command-line argument
    - 4    
      

      + Correct!
