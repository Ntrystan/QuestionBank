    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           in_str = input('Enter a string: ')    
           a = ''    
           d = 0    
           r = 1    
        
           for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':    
               if c in in_str:    
                   a = c + a    
               else:    
                   d = d + 1    
           r += 2    
        
           print(a) # Line 1    
           print(d) # Line 2    
           print(r) # Line 3    
        
    Given the input ``'Frick & Frack'``\ what output is produced by Line 1?    
    

    - FrickFrack    
      

      - Essentially this is filtering out all the upper case and non-alphabetic    
        characters.  The for loop goes through each lower-case letter, and if that    
        letter is in the input string in_str, we concatenate the letter to the    
        variable a.
    - kcarkcir

      + Correct!
    - none of the above
