    txtName.SetFocus    
        
    txtName.SelStart = 0    
        
    txtName.SelLength = Len(txtName.Text)    
        
    txtName is an edit text box which is currently visible.    
        
    What is the code expected to do?    
    

    - Clear the text in txtName.    
      

      - The code sets focus to the text box and by selecting the focus area from start    
        of the text box to its end thereby highlights the contents
    - Copy the text in txtName to the clipboard.
