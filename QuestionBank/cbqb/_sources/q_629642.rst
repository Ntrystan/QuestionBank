    The word ``abstract`` in the class box for ``Vehicle`` means:    
    

    - ``Vehicle`` is the top level of the hierarchy    
      

      - An object cannot be _directly_ instantiated from an abstract class, i.e.    
        `Vehicle v = new Vehicle();` is not legit, so B is true.  It is also true that    
        every concrete (non-abstract) subclass of Vehicle must implement or inherit    
        all of the methods defined as abstract in `Vehicle`.  So D is the answer.
    - Objects of type ``Vehicle`` can not be instantiated

    - All concrete subclasses of ``Vehicle`` must implement or inherit all of    
      ``Vehicle``\ 's ``abstract`` methods

    - Both B and C are true    
      

      + Correct!
    - All of the above
