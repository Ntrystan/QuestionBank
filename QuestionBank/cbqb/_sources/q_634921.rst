    In quicksort, what does partitioning refer to?    
    

    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      How the list/array always has three partitions: the area before low, the area    
      between\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      low and high, and the area after high.    
      

      - D is how it works.
    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      The process in which the memory allocated for the list/array that you are    
      sorting is\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      partitioned into different parts of memory, to improve memory efficiency.    
      

      - D is how it works.
    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      The process in which the list/array is partitioned into two equal halves; the    
      sort proceeds\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      by recursively partitioning until we have partitions of size 2, in which case    
      elements are\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      merged in correct order.    
      

      - D is how it works.
    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      The step where all elements less than a given *pivot* are placed on the left    
      of the pivot,\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      and all elements larger than the pivot are moved to the right.    
      

      + Correct!
