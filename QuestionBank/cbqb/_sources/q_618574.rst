    What is wrong with this code?    
        
    interface A{    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
           abstract double aMethod();    
        
        
    }    
        
    interface B{    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
             abstract int aMethod();    
        
        
    }    
        
    class testInterface implements A, B{    
        
    }    
    

    - A class cannot implement more than one interface.    
      

      - Methods defined in an interface should not be abstract.
    - Both the interfaces have a method with the same name and different return    
      type.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Methods defined in an interface should not be abstract.    
      

      - Methods defined in an interface should not be abstract.
    - aMethod should be overridden in testInterface class.    
      

      - Methods defined in an interface should not be abstract.
