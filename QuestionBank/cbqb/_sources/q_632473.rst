    The Big-Oh time complexity of this method is:    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - The factorial method will be called n times, so the time complexity is    
        proportional to n.
    - O(log n)    
      

      - The factorial method will be called n times, so the time complexity is    
        proportional to n.
    - O(n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n2)    
      

      - The factorial method will be called n times, so the time complexity is    
        proportional to n.
    - none of the above    
      

      - The factorial method will be called n times, so the time complexity is    
        proportional to n.
