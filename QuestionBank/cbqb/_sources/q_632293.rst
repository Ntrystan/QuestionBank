    Consider the following Java method:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public T pop() { // 1    
              T tmp; // 2    
              if (this.top == null) // 3    
                 tmp = null; // 4    
              else { // 5    
                 tmp = this.top.getElement(); // 6    
                 this.top = this.top.getNext(); // 7    
              } // 8    
              return tmp; // 9    
           } // 10    
        
    What would happen if line 7 were before line 6?    
    

    - The code would not compile.    
      

      - If the two lines are re-ordered, the code will change the value of top to the    
        second node, and then the second value in the stack will be the one that is    
        returned.
    - The code would compile, but it wouldn't run.    
      

      - If the two lines are re-ordered, the code will change the value of top to the    
        second node, and then the second value in the stack will be the one that is    
        returned.
    - The code would compile and run, but it would return the wrong value.    
      

      + Correct!
    - The code would compile and run, and it would work just the same.    
      

      - If the two lines are re-ordered, the code will change the value of top to the    
        second node, and then the second value in the stack will be the one that is    
        returned.
