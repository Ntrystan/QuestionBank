    Considering the following code, which of the choices are wrong when access to    
    ID is desired?    
        
    class N{    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
           private int ID;    
        
           public void setID(int id){    
        
                     >    
        
           }    
        
           public int getID(){    
        
                     return ID;    
        
           }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - if we had the following in class N    
          
      N n = new N();    
          
      System.out.print(n.ID);    
      

      - If we had the following in class N    
            
        System.out.print(ID);
    - If we had the following in another class but the same package as N    
          
      N n = new N();    
          
      System.out.print(n.ID);    
      

      + Correct!
    - If we had the following in class N    
          
      System.out.print(ID);    
      

      - If we had the following in class N    
            
        System.out.print(ID);
    - If we had the following in another class but the same package as N    
          
      N n = new N();    
          
      System.out.print(n.getID());    
      

      - If we had the following in class N    
            
        System.out.print(ID);
