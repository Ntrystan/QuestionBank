    Suppose the following Java code prints "statement 2":    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           if (num < 6) {    
              System.out.println("statement 1");    
           } else {    
              System.out.println("statement 2");    
           }    
        
    What must be true about num?    
    

    - greater than 6    
      

      - The opposite of less than is greater than or equal to.  Not just greater than.
    - greater than or equal to 6    
      

      + Correct!
    - less than 6    
      

      - The opposite of less than is greater than or equal to.  Not just greater than.
    - less than or equal to 6    
      

      - The opposite of less than is greater than or equal to.  Not just greater than.
    - this program cannot print "statement 2"    
      

      - The opposite of less than is greater than or equal to.  Not just greater than.
