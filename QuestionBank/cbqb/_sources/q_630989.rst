    For any JUnit test class, when is the ``setUp()`` method executed?    
    

    - Only when explicitly invoked    
      

      - The `setUp()` method is used to set up the same starting conditions for all    
        test methods in a test class.  It is automatically executed before each test    
        method, for every test method in the class.
    - Once before all the test methods are executed    
      

      - The `setUp()` method is used to set up the same starting conditions for all    
        test methods in a test class.  It is automatically executed before each test    
        method, for every test method in the class.
    - Each time before a test method is executed    
      

      + Correct!
    - Only after the test class constructor method is executed    
      

      - The `setUp()` method is used to set up the same starting conditions for all    
        test methods in a test class.  It is automatically executed before each test    
        method, for every test method in the class.
    - None of the above
