    The **Fibonacci sequence** is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ... Any term (value) of    
    the sequence that follows the first two terms (0 and 1) is equal to the sum of    
    the preceding two terms. Consider the following incomplete method to compute    
    any term of the Fibonacci sequence:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public static int fibonacci(int term)    
           {    
               int fib1 = 0;          // Line 1    
               int fib2 = 1;          // Line 2    
               int fibn = 0;          // Line 3    
        
               if (term == 1)         // Line 4    
               {    
                   return fib1;       // Line 5    
               }    
               if (term == 2)         // Line 6    
               {    
                   return fib2;       // Line 7    
               }    
        
               for (__________)       // Line 8: loop to the nth term    
               {    
                   fibn = __________; // Line 9: compute the next term    
                   fib1 = __________; // Line 10: reset the second preceding term    
                   fib2 = __________; // Line 11: reset the immediate preceding term    
               }    
               return fibn;           // Line 12: return the computed term    
           }    
        
        
           Choose the best answer to fill in the blank on line 9.    
    

    - ``fib2 - fib1``    
      

      - As described in the first part of the question, each term in the sequence is    
        the sum of the previous two terms, so `fibn = fib1 + fib2`.
    - ``fib1 + fibn``    
      

      - As described in the first part of the question, each term in the sequence is    
        the sum of the previous two terms, so `fibn = fib1 + fib2`.
    - ``fibn + fib2``    
      

      - As described in the first part of the question, each term in the sequence is    
        the sum of the previous two terms, so `fibn = fib1 + fib2`.
    - ``fib1 + fib2``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``fib2``    
      

      - As described in the first part of the question, each term in the sequence is    
        the sum of the previous two terms, so `fibn = fib1 + fib2`.
