    - ``counter``    
      

      - The return type of the method is `int`, so an integer return value must be    
        provided.  Since `counter` is used as a loop index, it will always end up    
        being the total number of characters in the given string.  The variable    
        `totalA` is used as an accumulator that is incremented each time a letter A is    
        found in the string, so it is the choice that will provide the correct return    
        value for the method.
    - ``true``
