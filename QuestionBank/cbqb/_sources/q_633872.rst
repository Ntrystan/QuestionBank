    Thomas has the following program that he is running on a 64-bit machine:    
        
    ``#include<stdlib.h>``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int main()    
           {    
               int x = rand();    
               int y = rand();    
           }    
        
    What is **not** true about y?    
    

    - y is less than RAND_MAX    
      

      + Correct!
    - y is four bytes in size    
      

      - y <= RAND_MAX, not y < RAND_MAX. As rand has not been seeded, and is    
        pseudorandomly generated, y can theoretically be deduced from x.
    - y is stored in the same stack frame as x    
      

      - y <= RAND_MAX, not y < RAND_MAX. As rand has not been seeded, and is    
        pseudorandomly generated, y can theoretically be deduced from x.
    - y's value cannot be deduced from x's    
      

      - y <= RAND_MAX, not y < RAND_MAX. As rand has not been seeded, and is    
        pseudorandomly generated, y can theoretically be deduced from x.
