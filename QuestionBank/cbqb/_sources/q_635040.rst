    The *lifetime* of a parameter in Java is    
    

    - Really long    
      

      - The lifetime of a variable is the duration over which it keeps a value unless    
        you change it.   With a parameter, its value is set when you invoke the    
        method, and it retains that value (or what every you subsequently set it to)    
        until you return.
    - From when its method is called until it returns    
      

      + Correct!
    - From when you define the method until you quit out of Eclipse

    - As long as the program is running
