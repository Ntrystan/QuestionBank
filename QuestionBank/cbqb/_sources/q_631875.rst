    Given the code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           if (x >= 0)    
              System.out.println("1");    
           else if (x < 20)    
              System.out.println("2");    
           else    
              System.out.println("3");    
           System.out.println("4");    
        
    for what integer values of x will ``4`` be among the values printed?    
    

    - x < 0    
      

      - The final `println` statement is outside the conditional, so it is printed    
        whatever the value of `x` is.
    - x >= 0    
      

      - The final `println` statement is outside the conditional, so it is printed    
        whatever the value of `x` is.
    - x >= 20    
      

      - The final `println` statement is outside the conditional, so it is printed    
        whatever the value of `x` is.
    - All values of x    
      

      + Correct!
    - None of the above.    
      

      - The final `println` statement is outside the conditional, so it is printed    
        whatever the value of `x` is.
