    Suppose you have an array of seven ``int`` values called ``test`` containing the    
    following data:    
        
        
    .. image:: img/28.png    
       :target: img/28.png    
       :alt: no description    
        
        
    Trace the execution of the following code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int x = 0;    
           int y = 0;    
           for (int i = 0; i < test.length; i++)    
           {    
               if (test[i] % 6 == 0)    
               {    
                   x++;    
                   y += i;    
               }    
           }    
        
    What is the value of ``x`` when this loop is done?    
    

    - 0    
      

      - The variable `x` is incremented for each value in the array that is evenly    
        divisible by 6, so the final value of `x` after the loop is 5.
    - 3    
      

      - The variable `x` is incremented for each value in the array that is evenly    
        divisible by 6, so the final value of `x` after the loop is 5.
    - 4

    - 5    
      

      + Correct!
