    How many times does the following Java code print "hello world"?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           for (int i=10; i>=4; i++) {    
              System.out.print("hello world");    
           }    
    

    - 0    
      

      - Trick question!  This is an infinite loop, because the update condition is    
        i++, but we are starting at 10 and continue while i>=4!
    - 1
