    Consider the code    
        
    ``int i, *q, *p;``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           p = &i;    
           q = p;    
           *p = 5;    
        
    Which of the following will print out "The value is 5."?    
    

    - printf("The value is %d", &i);    
      

      - q and p are sharing
    - printf("The value is %d", p);    
      

      - q and p are sharing
    - printf("The value is %d", *q);    
      

      + Correct!
    - printf("The value is %d", *i);    
      

      - q and p are sharing
