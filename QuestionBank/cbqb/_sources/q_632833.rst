    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           if x >= 0:    
               print (1)    
           elif x < 20:    
               print(2)    
           else:    
               print(3)    
           print(4)    
        
    For what integer values of ``x`` will 1 be among the values printed?    
    

    - ``x < 0``    
      

      - Clearly x must be greather than or equal to 0 to for 1 to be printed.
    - ``x >= 0``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``x >= 20``    
      

      - Clearly x must be greather than or equal to 0 to for 1 to be printed.
    - All values of ``x``    
      

      - Clearly x must be greather than or equal to 0 to for 1 to be printed.
    - None of the above    
      

      - Clearly x must be greather than or equal to 0 to for 1 to be printed.
