    Suppose you have a binary search tree with no left children. Duplicate keys    
    are not allowed. Which of the following explains how this tree may have ended    
    up this way?    
    

    - It was filled in ascending order.    
      

      + Correct!
    - The root value was the maximum.    
      

      - If the least node was inserted first, with each successive node having a    
        greater key than its predecessor, we'd end up with all right children. Adding    
        nodes with identical keys is prohibited by the problem statement, though it    
        would yield a similar tree.
    - All keys were identical.    
      

      - If the least node was inserted first, with each successive node having a    
        greater key than its predecessor, we'd end up with all right children. Adding    
        nodes with identical keys is prohibited by the problem statement, though it    
        would yield a similar tree.
    - The tree is a preorder tree.    
      

      - If the least node was inserted first, with each successive node having a    
        greater key than its predecessor, we'd end up with all right children. Adding    
        nodes with identical keys is prohibited by the problem statement, though it    
        would yield a similar tree.
    - It was filled in descending order.    
      

      - If the least node was inserted first, with each successive node having a    
        greater key than its predecessor, we'd end up with all right children. Adding    
        nodes with identical keys is prohibited by the problem statement, though it
