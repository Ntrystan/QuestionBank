    Consider the following code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           number = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))    
           while number > 1:    
              if (number % 2 == 1):    
                 number = number * 3 + 1    
              else:    
                 number = number/2    
              print number    
              if number == 1:    
                 break    
           else:    
              print "The end"    
        
    What output is produced when the input is '-1'?    
    

    - an error    
      

      - if number is not greater than 1, we immediately get to "The end".  In Python,    
        while loops are allowed to have an else statement.
    - The end    
      

      + Correct!
    - no output is produced    
      

      - if number is not greater than 1, we immediately get to "The end".  In Python,    
        while loops are allowed to have an else statement.
    - -1    
      

      - if number is not greater than 1, we immediately get to "The end".  In Python,    
        while loops are allowed to have an else statement.
    - none of the above    
      

      - if number is not greater than 1, we immediately get to "The end".  In Python,    
        while loops are allowed to have an else statement.
