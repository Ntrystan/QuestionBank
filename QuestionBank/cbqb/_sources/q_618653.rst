    A compiler error existed in this code. Why is that happening?    
        
    public class test {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
         static int testCount;    
        
         public int getCount(){    
        
             return testCount;    
        
         }    
        
         public test(){    
        
             testCount ++;    
        
         }    
        
         public static void main(String [] Args){    
        
             System.out.print(getCount());    
        
         }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - testCount has not been initialized    
      

      - testCount as a static variable cannot be referenced in a non-static method    
        such as getCount() or a constructor such as test().
    - getCount() cannot be called inside main method.    
      

      + Correct!
    - testCount as a static variable cannot be referenced in a non-static method    
      such as getCount() or a constructor such as test().    
      

      - testCount as a static variable cannot be referenced in a non-static method    
        such as getCount() or a constructor such as test().
    - testCount's access modifier is not public.    
      

      - testCount as a static variable cannot be referenced in a non-static method    
        such as getCount() or a constructor such as test().
