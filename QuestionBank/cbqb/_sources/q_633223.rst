    What is the output of the following program?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class Main {    
             public static void swap(int a, int b) {    
               int tmp = a;    
               a = b;    
               b = tmp;    
             }    
        
             public static void main(String[] args) {    
               int a = 5, b = 7;    
               swap(a, b);    
               System.out.println(a + " " + b);    
             }    
           }    
    

    - 7 5    
      

      - Main.swap only receives copies of main's a and b. Its assignments do not alter    
        main's variables. Thus, a is still 5 and b is still 7 when the print statement    
        is executed.
    - 5 7    
      

      + Correct!
    - 5 5
