    Suppose you place m items in a hash table with an array size of s. What is the    
    correct formula for the load factor?    
    

    - s + m    
      

      - The load factor is the number of elements in the array, divided by the size of    
        the array. It gives you an idea of how full the hashtable is.
    - s − m    
      

      - The load factor is the number of elements in the array, divided by the size of    
        the array. It gives you an idea of how full the hashtable is.
    - m − s    
      

      - The load factor is the number of elements in the array, divided by the size of    
        the array. It gives you an idea of how full the hashtable is.
    - s/m    
      

      - The load factor is the number of elements in the array, divided by the size of    
        the array. It gives you an idea of how full the hashtable is.
    - m/s    
      

      + Correct!
