    What would be the performance of a method called addAfter(p), in which p is a    
    position of a node or an index of an array, if the data structure is    
    implemented by an array or linked list structure respectively?    
    

    - O(1), O(1)    
      

      - O(n), O(1)
    - O(1), O(n)    
      

      - O(n), O(1)
    - O(n), O(1)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n), O(n)    
      

      - O(n), O(1)
