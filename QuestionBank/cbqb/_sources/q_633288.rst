    What operation contributes the log N to heap sort's O(N log N) complexity?    
    

    - Trickling up only    
      

      - The heapsort involves inserting all elements and removing all elements.    
        Inserting requires a trickle up and removing requires a trickle down.
    - Trickling down only    
      

      - The heapsort involves inserting all elements and removing all elements.    
        Inserting requires a trickle up and removing requires a trickle down.
    - Both trickling up and trickling down    
      

      + Correct!
    - Searching the array    
      

      - The heapsort involves inserting all elements and removing all elements.    
        Inserting requires a trickle up and removing requires a trickle down.
    - Splitting the array in half    
      

      - The heapsort involves inserting all elements and removing all elements.    
        Inserting requires a trickle up and removing requires a trickle down.
