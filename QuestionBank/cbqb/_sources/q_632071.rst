    What is the correct way to declare pFile as a file pointer?    
    

    - FILE *pFile;    
      

      + Correct!
    - FILE pFile*;    
      

      - FILE *    
            
        For C File I/O you need to use a FILE pointer, which will let the program keep    
        track of the file being accessed. (You can think of it as the memory address    
        of the file or the location of the file).
