    Consider this code. It is part of a program that receives MMP list votes from    
    constituencies and stores them in a database. The field PartyName stores the    
    names of each party involved, and the field VoteTotal keeps a running total of    
    list votes for a party. Tally is a table-type Recordset.    
        
    Do    
        
       ' Get a name and vote pair from the newly arrived text    
        
       ' Returns 0 when there are no more pairs    
        
       Start% = ExtractNextPair((txtData.Caption), Start%,_\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
                                                    PartyName$,_Votes&)    
        
       If Start% > 0 Then    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        ' See if the party name is already present    
        
        KeyField$ = UCase$(Trim$(PartyName$))    
        
       Tally.Seek "=", KeyField$    
        
        If Tally.NoMatch Then    
        
          ' Add a new record    
        
          Tally.AddNew    
        
          Tally("PartyName") = KeyField$    
        
          Tally("VoteTotal") = Votes    
        
       Else    
        
           ' Update the existing record - add latest votes    
        
           Tally.Edit    
        
           Tally("VoteTotal") = Tally("VoteTotal") + Votes    
        
       End If    
        
        
      End If    
        
    Loop While Start% > 0    
        
    Tally.Update    
        
    Why does this code not successfully store all the incoming data?    
    

    - The loop logic is wrong - it should be Start% < 0    
      

      - Because the line Tally.Update is outside the loop it is only executed once at    
        the end of the program
    - There was no call to Tally.Refresh    
      

      - Because the line Tally.Update is outside the loop it is only executed once at    
        the end of the program
    - There was no call to Tally.UpdateRecords    
      

      - Because the line Tally.Update is outside the loop it is only executed once at    
        the end of the program
    - The line Tally.Update must come inside the loop    
      

      + Correct!
    - The AddNew and Edit lines should be swapped    
      

      - Because the line Tally.Update is outside the loop it is only executed once at    
        the end of the program
