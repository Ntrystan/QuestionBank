    What does a binary tree **not** have in common with a doubly-linked list?    
    

    - A node's definition has (at least) two pointers defined    
      

      + Correct!
    - If a node A points to a node B, then B will point to A    
      

      - Only the binary tree is hierarchical; only the linked list will have symmetric    
        pointers.
    - A given node will be pointed to at most one other node    
      

      - Only the binary tree is hierarchical; only the linked list will have symmetric    
        pointers.
