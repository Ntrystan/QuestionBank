    Consider the following function. What does it return?    
        
    public boolean nameTester(String inValue) {\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
        String oldValue = "mikeyg";\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
        return (inValue == oldValue);\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    }    
    

    - True, regardless of the value of *inValue*    
      

      - The == (equality operator) for objects (strings are objects in Java) returns    
        True when both operands refer to the same object.  In this case, there are two    
        distinct objects, who might contain the same value ("mikeyg").
    - False, regardless of the value of *inValue*    
      

      + Correct!
    - It depends.  If inValue is assigned the value "mikeyg," then True; otherwise    
      False.
