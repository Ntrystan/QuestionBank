    For the binary search algorithm implemented on a sorted list stored in an    
    array, what is its running time?    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - Binary search repeately "throws away" half of the list still under    
        investigation when looking for a given value in the list.  Hence the run time    
        of the algorithm is the number of times a values can be divided in two, until    
        one reaches the value 1: O(log2 n)
    - O(log2 n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n)    
      

      - Binary search repeately "throws away" half of the list still under    
        investigation when looking for a given value in the list.  Hence the run time    
        of the algorithm is the number of times a values can be divided in two, until    
        one reaches the value 1: O(log2 n)
    - O(n log2 n)
