    What will be output by this loop?    
        
    for(n = 1, m = 5; n <= 5; n++, m--)    
        
    printf("%d %d\n", n, m);    
    

    - 1 5    
          
      2 4    
          
      3 3    
          
      4 2    
          
      5 1    
      

      + Correct!

      - The loop increments the value of n and decrements the value of m on each    
        iteration printing the value of each variable, until n reaches the terminal    
        value of 5
