    After the Java assignment statement    
        
       ``String word = "blank";``    
        
    which of the following Java code fragments prints    
        
       ``blink``    
        
    ?    
    

    - [code]    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         word[2] = "i";    
         System.out.println(word);    
          
          
      ```    
      

      - (a) is wrong because the Java syntax word[n] requires the variable word to be    
        an array. (c) is almost right; it just needs to have a 2 instead of the 1 in    
        the first call to substring. Since (a) and (c) are wrong, (d) must be wrong.    
        (b) is correct, so (e) must be wrong.
    - ``word.replaceAll("a","i");``    
          
      ``System.out.println(word);``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``word = word.substring(0,1) + "i" + word.substring(3,5);``    
          
      ``System.out.println(word);``

        an array. (c) is almost right; it just needs to have a 2 instead of the 1 in    
        the first call to substring. Since (a) and (c) are wrong, (d) must be wrong.    
        (b) is correct, so (e) must be wrong.
    - All of (a)-(c).
