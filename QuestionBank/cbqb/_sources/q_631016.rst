    In Java, what value will the variable ``i`` have after this declaration:    
        
    ``int i = 2 + 8 % 4;``    
    

    - 0    
      

      - When evaluating the initialization expression, precedence requires the modulo    
        operator % to be applied first. 8 % 4 produces the value 0, since 8 divided by    
        4 has a remainder of zero.  When zero is then added to 2, the result is 2,    
        which becomes the initial value of the newly declared variable.
    - 2    
      

      + Correct!
