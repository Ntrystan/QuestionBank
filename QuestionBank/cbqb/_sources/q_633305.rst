    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           s = input('Enter a string: ')    
           w = ''    
           for c in s:    
              if c in "0123456789":    
                 #REPLACE    
              else:    
                 w = w + c    
           print w    
        
    What replacement for the comment #REPLACE will cause the program to print the    
    input string with all of the digits removed?  In other words, for the    
    'aaa3b3c1', we would print 'aaabc'.    
    

    - break    
      

      - A is wrong because break will end the loop.    
            
        C is wrong because the problem asks us to print, not to return.    
            
        The continue statement works because it goes back to the top of the loop.
    - continue    
      

      + Correct!
    - return w    
      

      - A is wrong because break will end the loop.    
            
        C is wrong because the problem asks us to print, not to return.    
            
        The continue statement works because it goes back to the top of the loop.
    - any of the above
