    After calling the following function, what will the values of n and m be?    
    Assume that before\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    calling the function, n = 2 and m = 5.    
        
    ``void example(int *n, int *m)      
    {      
       *n++;      
       *m += 5;      
    }``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           void main()    
           {    
              int n = 2;    
              int m = 5;    
              example(&n, &m);    
              printf("n = %d and m = %d", n, m);    
           }    
    

    - n = 2 and m = 5    
      

      - Due to order of operations, the ++ will not change n.
    - n = 3 and m = 5    
      

      - Due to order of operations, the ++ will not change n.
    - n = 2 and m = 10    
      

      + Correct!
    - n = 3 and m = 10    
      

      - Due to order of operations, the ++ will not change n.
