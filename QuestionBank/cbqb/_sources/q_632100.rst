    Only one of the following will not compile and run under Quick C. Which one?    
    

    - main(){}    
      

      - The semi-colon end of line delimiter occurs within a curly bracket pairing,    
        which is not a logical combination from the compiler's parsing perspective
    - main(void){}    
      

      - The semi-colon end of line delimiter occurs within a curly bracket pairing,    
        which is not a logical combination from the compiler's parsing perspective
    - int main(){return 65535;}    
      

      + Correct!
    - int main(void){return 1}    
      

      - The semi-colon end of line delimiter occurs within a curly bracket pairing,    
        which is not a logical combination from the compiler's parsing perspective
    - void main(void){}    
      

      - The semi-colon end of line delimiter occurs within a curly bracket pairing,    
        which is not a logical combination from the compiler's parsing perspective
