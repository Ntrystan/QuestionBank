    If the StackADT operation ``push`` is implemented using a linked list, the big-    
    Oh time complexity of the method is:    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(log2n)    
      

      - The push method adds a new element to a stack. Regardless of the size of the    
        list, the operations needed to add a new element include creating a node to    
        store it in and setting the values of a few pointers, all of which can be done    
        in constant time.
    - O(n)
