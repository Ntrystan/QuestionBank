    Which of the following lines of code will correctly read in the integer value    
    foo?    
    

    - scanf("%d", &foo);    
      

      + Correct!
    - scanf("%f", foo);    
      

      - (A) is the correct answer; %d is used for reading in integers. The \n in (D)    
        is unnecessary. Finally, scanf requires a pointer to a variable's address --    
        hence the ampersand.
    - scanf("%f", &foo);

    - scanf("%f\n", foo);
