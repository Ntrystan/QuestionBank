    You've got this Word class for a project you are working on:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           class Word {    
             private String letters;    
             ...    
             public int hashCode() {    
               return letters.charAt(1);    
             }    
           }

    - aa, bb, cc, dd    
      

      - The hashCode examines the second letter of each word to find the location in
