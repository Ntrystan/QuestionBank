    Consider the following Java method:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public void printMenu(){    
              System.out.println("Choose one of the following options:");    
              System.out.println("1) Display account balance");    
              System.out.println("2) Make deposit");    
              System.out.println("3) Make withdrawal");    
              System.out.println("4) Quit");    
           }    
        
    Select the best reason for making this a separate method with a name, instead    
    of including the code in some other method:    
    

    - Otherwise, you would have to write the same code more than once.    
      

      + Correct!
    - By breaking your program up into logical parts, you make it more readable.    
      

      - There are multiple correct answers to this question. A, B, and C are all    
        reasonable answers. D is less good, because while it's a good idea to keep    
        your methods relatively short, it won't always make sense to stick to an    
        arbitrary limit like 20 lines.

    - It's necessary to keep the calling method under 20 lines long.
