    The simplified UML diagram above shows the relationships among Java classes    
    Bird, Crow, and Duck.    
        
    Suppose Russell is an instance of Crow and Howard is an instance of Duck.    
        
    Which of the following is not necessarily true?    
    

    - Howard and Russell have different capabilities    
      

      + Correct!
    - Crows and Ducks inherit from Birds    
      

      - Howard and Russell are instances of different classes  (Duck and Crow), each    
        of which is a subclass of Bird.  If neither Crow nor Duck define any methods,    
        then Howard and Russell will have the same methods (i.e. capabilities) as    
        Bird.
    - Crow is a subclass of Bird    
      

      - Howard and Russell are instances of different classes  (Duck and Crow), each    
        of which is a subclass of Bird.  If neither Crow nor Duck define any methods,    
        then Howard and Russell will have the same methods (i.e. capabilities) as    
        Bird.
    - Bird is a superclass of Duck    
      

      - Howard and Russell are instances of different classes  (Duck and Crow), each    
        of which is a subclass of Bird.  If neither Crow nor Duck define any methods,    
        then Howard and Russell will have the same methods (i.e. capabilities) as    
        Bird.
    - Bird is more general than Duck    
      

      - Howard and Russell are instances of different classes  (Duck and Crow), each    
        of which is a subclass of Bird.  If neither Crow nor Duck define any methods,    
        then Howard and Russell will have the same methods (i.e. capabilities) as    
        Bird.
