    Consider the following short program, which does not meet all institutional    
    coding standards:    
        
    void vCodeString(char szText[ ]); /\ * First line *\ /    
        
    include <stdio.h>    
    =================    
        
    include <string.h>    
    ==================    
        
    define MAX_LEN 12    
    =================    
        
    int main(void)    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        char szData[MAX_LEN];    
        
        printf("Enter some text to code: ");    
        
       scanf("%s", szData);    
        
       vCodeString(szData); /* Line 8 */    
        
        printf("Coded string is %s\n", szData);    
        
        
    }    
        
    void vCodeString(char szText[ ])    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        int i = -1;    
        
        while(szText[++i])    
        
        {    
        
               szText[i] += (char)2;    
        
        }    
        
        
    }    
        
    Why is there no address operator (&) before szData in the scanf line?:    
    

    - Parameters are passed to scanf by value, not by reference.    
      

      - On declaration of a variable a space in memory is reserved for its storage.    
        Here szData is an array of type char which has already been defined in the    
        program and a memory location has been allocated to it
    - scanf takes only inward parameters so does not need the &    
      

      - On declaration of a variable a space in memory is reserved for its storage.    
        Here szData is an array of type char which has already been defined in the    
        program and a memory location has been allocated to it
    - szData is the address of the array.    
      

      + Correct!
    - szData is an array so it does not have an address.    
      

      - On declaration of a variable a space in memory is reserved for its storage.    
        Here szData is an array of type char which has already been defined in the    
        program and a memory location has been allocated to it
    - Variables of type char cannot use the address operator.

        Here szData is an array of type char which has already been defined in the    
        program and a memory location has been allocated to it
