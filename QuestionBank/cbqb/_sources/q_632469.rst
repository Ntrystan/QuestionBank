    Identify the bug in the following code (if any):    
        
    ``public boolean search(T item,MyList<T> list){ // 1``    
        
    ``this.search(item, list.getRest()); // 2``    
        
    ``} // 3``    
    

    - There is no base case    
      

      + Correct!
    - The problem is not self-similar    
      

      - For a recursive solution to a problem, you need three things:    
            
        (1) a base case (where the problem can be solved without recursion)    
            
        (2) a self-similar problem (one that contains similar problem(s) to itself)    
            
        (3) a way of making the problem smaller so you get closer to the base case    
            
        Here (2) is satisfied -- lists contain smaller lists. (3) is satisfied by line    
        2 of the method. But there is no base case.
    - There is a base case, but the problem does not get smaller

    - None of the above
