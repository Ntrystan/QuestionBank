    What will the following code output?    
        
    ``int arr[5];``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int *p = arr;    
           printf("p is %p -- ", p);    
           ++p;    
           printf("p is %p \n", p);    
    

    - p is 0x7fffb04846d0 - p is 0x7fffb04846d1    
      

      - p will increase by the sizeof(int) == 4.
    - p is 0x7fffb04846d0 - p is 0x7fffb04846d2    
      

      - p will increase by the sizeof(int) == 4.
    - p is 0x7fffb04846d0 - p is 0x7fffb04846d4    
      

      + Correct!
    - Segmentation fault    
      

      - p will increase by the sizeof(int) == 4.
