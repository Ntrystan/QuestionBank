    What does this print?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           double d = 8 / 10;    
           System.out.println(d);    
    

    - d    
      

      - Integer division!  10 goes into 8 zero times, with a remainder of 8.  But    
        since this is integer division, we only care about the quotient, which is    
        zero!
    - 0    
      

      + Correct!
    - 0.8
