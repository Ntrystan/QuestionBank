    After the assignment ``signal = 'abracadabra'``\ , what is returned by    
    ``signal[:5]``\ ?    
    

    - 'abraca'    
      

      - This is a slice operation.  Slices in Python work with both lists and with    
        Strings, and go up to but not including the limit.  Since the limit is 5, we    
        get the first 5 characters (indexed 0 through 4).  Hence abrac
    - 'abrac'
