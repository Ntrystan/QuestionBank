    After the assignments ``a = True`` and ``b = True``\ , what is returned by ``(not a    
    or b) and (a or not b)``\ ?    
    

    - True    
      

      + Correct!
    - False    
      

      - the not operator has a higher precedence than or, so this expression should be    
        read:    
            
        ((not a) or b) and (a or (not b))    
            
        Which is True when a=True and b=False
    - 1    
      

      - the not operator has a higher precedence than or, so this expression should be    
        read:    
            
        ((not a) or b) and (a or (not b))    
            
        Which is True when a=True and b=False
    - 0
