    Finding the median value in a complete and balanced binary search tree is    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(log N)    
      

      - The median is the element that has M elements less than it and M elements    
        greater than it. This can only be said of the root node in a complete and    
        balanced binary tree. The root is accessed in constant time.
    - O(N)

    - O(N2)
