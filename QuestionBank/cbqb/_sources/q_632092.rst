        (here 10)
    - iVal & 10    
      

      - Expresses the value of a variable using the division operator and the divisor    
        (here 10)
    - iVal == 10    
      

      - Expresses the value of a variable using the division operator and the divisor    
        (here 10)
    - iVal / 10    
      

      + Correct!
    - iVal | 10
