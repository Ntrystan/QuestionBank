    Kexin is hashing the values 9, 45, 22, 48, 38 into a hash table of size 20.    
    Which hash function will give her no collisions?    
    

    - h(k) = k % 10    
      

      - A will collide on the 48/38; B will collide with 45/48; C will collide with    
        9/45.
    - h(k) = k / 10    
      

      - A will collide on the 48/38; B will collide with 45/48; C will collide with    
        9/45.
    - h(k) = (k % 10) + (k / 10)    
      

      - A will collide on the 48/38; B will collide with 45/48; C will collide with    
        9/45.
    - h(k) = (k % 10) - (k / 10)    
      

      + Correct!
