    Which data structure used to implement ``Set`` yields the worst performance for    
    ``Set.contains``\ ?    
    

    - Binary search tree    
      

      - Implementing Set.contains involves a search of the data structure. A binary    
        search tree and a sorted array are searched in O(lg n) time, and a hashtable    
        in O(1), assuming a sane hash function. A linked list is searched in O(n)    
        time.
    - Linked list    
      

      + Correct!
    - Sorted array
