    Assume that an object of the following class has just been created:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class Unknown    
           {    
               private int x;    
        
               public Unknown()    
               {    
                   x = 17;    
                   method1();    
                   method2(5);    
                   method3();    
                   System.out.println(x);      // Line D    
               }    
        
               public void method1()    
               {    
                   --x;    
                   int x = this.x;    
                   x++;    
                   System.out.println(this.x); // Line A    
               }    
        
               public void method2(int x)    
               {    
                   x++;    
                   System.out.println(x);      // Line B    
               }    
        
               public void method3()    
               {    
                   --x;    
                   int x = 2;    
                   x++;    
                   System.out.println(x);      // Line C    
               }    
           }    
        
    What output is produced by **Line B** when an instance of this class is    
    created?    
    

    - 3    
      

      - Line B prints the value of the parameter called `x in `method2()``.  That    
        parameter is given the value 5 when `method2()` is called from the    
        constructor, and then the parameter itself is incremented on the first line of    
        `method2()`, so the value printed is 6.
    - 5
