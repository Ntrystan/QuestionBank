    Suppose you have the following partial code to sum up an array of ``int``\ s:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int sum(int[] nums) {    
             int sum = 0;    
             ...    
             return sum;    
           }    
        
    Which of the following *does not* correctly complete this method?    
    

    - [code]    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i)    
           sum += nums[i];    
          
          
      ```    
      

      - It appears in this solution that we are iterating through the list in reverse.    
        However, we incorrectly increment the iterator, leading to an    
        IndexOutOfBoundsException.
    - [code]    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         for (int i : nums)    
           sum += i;    
          
          
      ```

      .. code-block::    
          
         for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; ++i)    
           sum += nums[i];    
          
          
      ```    
      

      + Correct!

         int i = 0;    
         while (i < nums.length) {    
           sum += nums[i];    
           ++i;    
         }
