    What does the following Java code print?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int outer=0;    
           for (int i=0; i<12; i++) {    
              if (i % 2 == 0) {    
                 outer++;    
              }    
           }    
           System.out.println(outer);    
    

    - 12    
      

      - i % 2 == 0 is true only when i is 0.  This loop counts the number of even    
        values between 0 and 12, exclusive (because the loop body doesn't execute when    
        i is 12, the loop ends instead).  In this case the result is 6 (0, 2, 4, 6, 8,    
        10).
    - 6    
      

      + Correct!
    - 3
