    Which of the following is most appropriate as the missing post-condition?    
        
    ``void move_north_east(int *x, int *y)``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           {    
               // Moves a robot north-east in our coordinate system    
               // by one step north and one step east    
               // PRE: x != NULL, y != NULL    
               // <missing post-condition>    
               (*x)++;    
               (*y)++;    
           }    
    

    - POST: x != NULL, y != NULL    
      

      - what x to points to is being updated, not x itself
    - POST: x is incremented; y is incremented    
      

      - what x to points to is being updated, not x itself
    - POST: x's pointee is incremented; y's pointee is incremented    
      

      + Correct!
    - POST: none    
      

      - what x to points to is being updated, not x itself
