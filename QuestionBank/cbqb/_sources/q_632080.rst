    Consider the following short program, which does not meet all institutional    
    coding standards:    
        
    void vCodeString(char szText[ ]); /\ * First line *\ /    
        
    include <stdio.h>    
    =================    
        
    include <string.h>    
    ==================    
        
    define MAX_LEN 12    
    =================    
        
    int main(void)    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        char szData[MAX_LEN];    
        
        printf("Enter some text to code: ");    
        
        scanf("%s", szData);    
        
        vCodeString(szData); /* Line 8 */    
        
        printf("Coded string is %s\n", szData);    
        
        
    }    
        
    void vCodeString(char szText[ ])    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        int i = -1;    
        
        while(szText[++i])    
        
        {    
        
                 szText[i] += (char)2;    
        
        }    
        
        
    }

    - an array declaration    
      

      - A function prototype or function interface in C, Perl, PHP or C++ is a    
        declaration of a function that omits the function body but does specify the    
        function's return type, name, arity and argument types. While a function    
        definition specifies what a function does, a function prototype can be thought    
        of as specifying its interface. [Source "Function prototype" Wikipedia]. Note    
        the function is called from Main at line 8 and defined at line 11.
