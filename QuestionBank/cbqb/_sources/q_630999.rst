    Consider the incomplete code segment below. The segment is supposed to    
    initialize a 4 x 4 matrix as shown in this image:

    .. code-block::    
        
        
           final int SIZE = _________;            // line 0    
            int matrix[][] = new int[SIZE][SIZE];  // line 1    
            for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)         // line 2    
            {    
               for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++)     // line 3    
               {    
                   if ( _________________ )       // line 4    
                   {    
                       matrix[i][j] = 4;          // line 5    
                   }    
                   else if ( _______________ )    // line 6

                       matrix[i][j] = 1;          // line 7    
                   }

    Select statement from the choices below that is the best choice to fill in the    
    blank on ``line 0`` of this code segment so that it behaves as desired.    
    

    - 3    
      

      - The constant `SIZE` is used to define the width and height of the array    
        (matrix), which is 4x4.
    - 4    
      

      + Correct!
    - 5    
      

      - The constant `SIZE` is used to define the width and height of the array    
        (matrix), which is 4x4.
    - 16    
      

      - The constant `SIZE` is used to define the width and height of the array    
        (matrix), which is 4x4.
    - None of these    
      

      - The constant `SIZE` is used to define the width and height of the array    
        (matrix), which is 4x4.
