    A chained hash table has an array size of 512. What is the maximum number of    
    entries that can be placed in the table?    
    

    - 256    
      

      - In a hashtable with chaining, each element is assigned to a particular cell in    
        the array (a "bucket") using the hash function. Each bucket has a pointer to    
        the start of a linked list, and the elements assigned to that bucket are    
        stored in the linked list.
