    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           if x >= 0:    
               print (1)    
           elif x < 20:    
               print(2)    
           else:    
               print(3)    
           print(4)    
        
    For what integer values of x will 3 be amont the values printed?    
    

    - x < 0    
      

      - It's not possible to get 3 to print.  This is because all possible values of x    
        are covered by if x>=0 and x<20.  This creates a range that includes all    
        possible values of x, since any number is either >=0 or < 20.
    - x >= 0

    - None of the above    
      

      + Correct!
