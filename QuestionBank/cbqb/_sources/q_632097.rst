    What is output from the following section of code?    
        
    int i = 4;    
        
    int j = i - 1;    
        
    printf("%d bows = %d wows", i, j+1);    
    

    - 3 bows = 4 wows    
      

      - Through the printf function the decimal integer values defined by the %d field    
        specifiers are replaced by the values for i and j resulting from the    
        expression. The value of variable j is both decremented and incremented to    
        remain equivalent to that of variable i when printed.
    - 4 bows = 4 wows    
      

      + Correct!
    - 3 bows = 5 wows
