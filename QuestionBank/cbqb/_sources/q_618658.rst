    A compiler error existed in this code. Why is that happening?    
        
    public class test {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
          final int testCount;    
        
          int classCount;    
        
          public int getCount(){    
        
                  return testCount+classCount;    
        
          }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - testCount and classCount have not been initialized.    
      

      - classCount has not been initialized.
    - testCount has not been initialized.    
      

      + Correct!
    - classCount has not been initialized.    
      

      - classCount has not been initialized.
    - testCount and classCount cannot be added in return statement.    
      

      - classCount has not been initialized.
