    int iTable[3][5]; /\ * Declaration *\ /    
        
    27 32 14   9 26

    What is the value of iTable [3] [4]?    
    

    - 3    
      

      - The index values for the array start from 0 so iTable [3] [4] refers to the    
        4th row and the 5th column, where the 4th row does not exist
