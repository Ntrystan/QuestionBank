    The time complexity of linear search is:    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - The time required for linear search in the worst case is directly proportional    
        to the amount of data.
    - O(log n)    
      

      - The time required for linear search in the worst case is directly proportional    
        to the amount of data.
    - O(n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(2n)    
      

      - The time required for linear search in the worst case is directly proportional    
        to the amount of data.
    - none of the above    
      

      - The time required for linear search in the worst case is directly proportional    
        to the amount of data.
