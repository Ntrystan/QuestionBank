    Junyoung runs the program after compiling with ``gcc print random number.c    
    -Wall``\ :    
        
    ``#include<stdlib.h>``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int main()    
           {    
              int x = rand();    
              printf("%d\n", x);    
           }    
        
    What is **not** true about it?    
    

    - GCC will give a warning since stdio.h was not included    
      

      - Rand was not seeded.
    - GCC will give a warning since ``main`` does not return an ``int``    
      

      - Rand was not seeded.
    - It will print a different number every time    
      

      + Correct!
    - It will only need four bytes of stack space    
      

      - Rand was not seeded.
