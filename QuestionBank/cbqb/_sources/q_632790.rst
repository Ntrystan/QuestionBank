    After the assignments ``x = 27`` and ``y = 12``\ , what is returned by\ ``x/y``\ ?    
    (Assume Python <= 2.7, not Python3).    
    

    - 2    
      

      + Correct!
    - 2.25    
      

      - This is an integer division question.  Python will return 2, since 27/12 is 2,    
        with a remainder.  But integer division only cares about the quotient, not the    
        remainder.    
            
        Note that you may get a different answer using Python3 rather than with    
        Python2.x
    - 3
