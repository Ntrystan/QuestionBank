    Given the following Boolean expression:    
        
    ``(jordan.getGridX() < 100) && (jordan.getGridY() >= 55)``    
        
    Which of the following is logically equivalent?    
    

    - ``!((jordan.getGridX() >= 100) || (jordan.getGridY() < 55))``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``((jordan.getGridX() >= 100) || (jordan.getGridY() < 55))``    
      

      - This question involves applying De Morgan's Law to factor out logical negation    
        from a Boolean expression to find an equivalent expression.
    - ``!((jordan.getGridX() > 100) || (jordan.getGridY() <= 55))``
