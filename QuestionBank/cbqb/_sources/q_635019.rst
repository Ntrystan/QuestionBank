    Suppose q is an instance of a queue that can store Strings, and I execute the    
    following statements starting with q empty:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           1. q.enqueue("Sweden");    
           2. q.enqueue("is");    
           3. q.enqueue("my");    
           4. String w = q.dequeue();    
           5. String x = q.peek();    
           6. q.enqueue("neighbor");    
           7. String y = q.dequeue();    
           8. String z = q.dequeue();    
        
    What is the value of z after executing these expressions in order?    
    

    - ``"Sweden"``    
      

      - If we consider the contents of the queue after each expression (listing    
        contents from head to tail), we have    
            
        1\. ["Sweden"]    
            
        2\. ["Sweden" "is"]    
            
        3\. ["Sweden" "is" "my"]    
            
        4\. ["is" "my"]  (and w gets set to "Sweden")    
            
        5\. ["is" "my"]  (and x gets set to "is")    
            
        6\. ["is" "my" "neighbor"]    
            
        7\. ["my" "neighbor"] (and y gets set to "is")    
            
        8\. [ "neighbor"]  (and z gets set to "my")
    - ``"is"``    
      

      - If we consider the contents of the queue after each expression (listing    
        contents from head to tail), we have    
            
        1\. ["Sweden"]    
            
        2\. ["Sweden" "is"]    
            
        3\. ["Sweden" "is" "my"]    
            
        4\. ["is" "my"]  (and w gets set to "Sweden")    
            
        5\. ["is" "my"]  (and x gets set to "is")    
            
        6\. ["is" "my" "neighbor"]    
            
        7\. ["my" "neighbor"] (and y gets set to "is")    
            
        8\. [ "neighbor"]  (and z gets set to "my")
    - ``"my"``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``"neighbor"``    
      

      - If we consider the contents of the queue after each expression (listing    
        contents from head to tail), we have

        2\. ["Sweden" "is"]    
            
        3\. ["Sweden" "is" "my"]    
            
        4\. ["is" "my"]  (and w gets set to "Sweden")    
            
        5\. ["is" "my"]  (and x gets set to "is")    
            
        6\. ["is" "my" "neighbor"]    
            
        7\. ["my" "neighbor"] (and y gets set to "is")    
            
        8\. [ "neighbor"]  (and z gets set to "my")
    - None of the above
