       1.  import java.util.ArrayList;    
       2.  public BallPanel extends javax.swing.JPanel {    
       3.     private ArrayList <Ball> _moreBalls;    
       4.     public BallPanel(int numberOfBalls){    
       5.        _moreBalls = new ArrayList<Ball>();    
       6.        for (int i=0;i<numberOfBalls;i++)    
       7.           _moreBalls.add(new Ball());    
       8.     }    
       9.  }    
        
        
    ```    
        
    What is the value of _moreBalls.size() immediately after lines 4 and 6    
    (respectively) if we invoke the BallPanel constructor?    
    

    - ``0, numberOfBalls``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``numberOfBalls, numberOfBalls``    
      

      - A is correct.  When you instantiate an ArrayList (in line 4) its size (the    
        number of elements in the ArrayList) is zero because you haven't added any    
        elements;  lines 5 and 6 add numberOfBalls elements to the ArrayList, so after    
        that the size is numberOfBalls.
    - ``i, numberOfBalls``    
      

      - A is correct.  When you instantiate an ArrayList (in line 4) its size (the    
        number of elements in the ArrayList) is zero because you haven't added any    
        elements;  lines 5 and 6 add numberOfBalls elements to the ArrayList, so after    
        that the size is numberOfBalls.
    - ``0, numberOfBalls - 1``    
      

      - A is correct.  When you instantiate an ArrayList (in line 4) its size (the    
        number of elements in the ArrayList) is zero because you haven't added any    
        elements;  lines 5 and 6 add numberOfBalls elements to the ArrayList, so after    
        that the size is numberOfBalls.
    - ``_moreBalls.size()`` is undefined
