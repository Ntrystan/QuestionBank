    The worst-case time complexity of the following Java method is:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public int fibonacci (int n) {    
              if (n == 1)     
                 return 1;    
              else if (n == 2)     
                 return 1;    
              else if (n > 2)    
        
    :raw-html-m2r:`<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">return&#96;&#96; fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2);</span></code>`    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
              else     
                 return -1; // invalid input    
        
    ``}``    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - This code is exponential, because it's doubly recursive.
    - O(log n)    
      

      - This code is exponential, because it's doubly recursive.
    - O(n)    
      

      - This code is exponential, because it's doubly recursive.
    - O(n2)    
      

      - This code is exponential, because it's doubly recursive.
    - none of the above    
      

      + Correct!
