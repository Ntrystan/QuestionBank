    In the above Java code, what is the value of ``_balls.length`` immediately after    
    lines 4 and 6 (respectively)?    
    

    - ``0, numberOfBalls``    
      

      - When the array is instantiated in line 4, its length is set (to    
        numberOfBalls).  Lines 5 and 6 set the values of the array elements, but do    
        not change the length of the array.
    - ``numberOfBalls, numberOfBalls``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``i, numberOfBalls``    
      

      - When the array is instantiated in line 4, its length is set (to    
        numberOfBalls).  Lines 5 and 6 set the values of the array elements, but do    
        not change the length of the array.
    - ``0, numberOfBalls - 1``    
      

      - When the array is instantiated in line 4, its length is set (to    
        numberOfBalls).  Lines 5 and 6 set the values of the array elements, but do    
        not change the length of the array.
    - ``_balls.length`` is undefined    
      

      - When the array is instantiated in line 4, its length is set (to    
        numberOfBalls).  Lines 5 and 6 set the values of the array elements, but do    
        not change the length of the array.
