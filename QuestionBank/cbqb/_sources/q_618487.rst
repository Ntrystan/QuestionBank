    To make the following code work without any error, one of the given solutions    
    is **not** right. Which one is it?    
        
    class D {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
         int Diameter;    
        
         public D(int d){    
        
               Diameter = d;    
        
         }    
        
        
    }    
        
    public class E {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
         public static void main(String arg[]){    
        
               D diam = new D();    
        
         }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - To omit the input argument of the constructor.    
      

      - To define a null constructor.
    - To define diam by passing an int value to constructor.    
      

      - To define a null constructor.
    - To define a null constructor.    
      

      - To define a null constructor.
    - To define the constructor private.    
      

      + Correct!
