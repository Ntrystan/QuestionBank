    Which of the following assertions is *incorrect*\ ?    
    

    - A Python statement may return a value    
      

      + Correct!
    - A Python expression may return a value    
      

      - Basically, a statement in Python is a special kind of function that doesn't    
        return a value.  Statements are things like `print` (in Python 2.x but not    
        Python 3) and `import`.    
            
        I think this is not a great question to put on a CS-1 exam beacuse it relies    
        on terminology (statement, expression, side-effect) that doesn't really mean    
        much until CS-2 or later.
    - A Python statement may produce a side effect

    - None of the above (i.e., all are correct)
