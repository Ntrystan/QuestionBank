    Consider the code\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    int i, *q, *\ p;\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    p = &i;\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    q = p;\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    *p = 5;    
        
    Which of the following will print out "The value is 5."?    
    

    - printf("The value is %d", &i);    
      

      - p and q are currently "sharing" --- they both point to the same variable (i).
    - printf("The value is %d", p);    
      

      - p and q are currently "sharing" --- they both point to the same variable (i).
    - printf("The value is %d", *q);    
      

      + Correct!
    - printf("The value is %d", *i);    
      

      - p and q are currently "sharing" --- they both point to the same variable (i).
