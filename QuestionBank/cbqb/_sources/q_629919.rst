    Consider the following Java interface definition:    
        
    public interface Mover {\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
       public int getX();\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
       public int getY();\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
       public void setLocation(int x, int y);\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    }    
        
    Which of the following is a correct implementation of the Mover interface?    
    

    - [code]    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         public class CartoonCharacter implements Mover{    
            private int x, y;    
            public int getX;    
            public int getY;    
            public void setLocation;    
          
          
      ```    
          
      ``}``    
      

      - Choice A is wrong because it doesn't include parameter lists or    
        implementations of any of the methods required by the interface.    
            
        Choice B is wrong because it doesn't include implementations of the methods on    
        the list.    
            
        Choice C is wrong because it implements some but not all of the interface    
        methods.    
            
        Choice E is wrong because the method signatures do not match those in the    
        interface.    
            
        Choice D is the correct answer, because it's the only one where the required    
        methods are all implemented, and their signatures match    
            
        **NOTE:**  There is no appropriate topic for this question in the list.
