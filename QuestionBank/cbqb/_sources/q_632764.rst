    Which one of the four lines indicated by the comments contains the logic    
    error?    
    

    - line 1    
      

      - line 3 should be `bestSoFar = y[i];`    
            
        `The buggy code is remembering an array position, but the correct code    
        remembers the value.`
    - line2    
      

      - line 3 should be `bestSoFar = y[i];`    
            
        `The buggy code is remembering an array position, but the correct code    
        remembers the value.`
    - line3    
      

      + Correct!
    - line4    
      

      - line 3 should be `bestSoFar = y[i];`    
            
        `The buggy code is remembering an array position, but the correct code    
        remembers the value.`
