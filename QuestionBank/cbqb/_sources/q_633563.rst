    Double hashing    
    

    - involves hashing the hash code    
      

      - With double hashing, a second hash function is used to determine the step size    
        for the probing sequence. With linear or quadratic probing, elements that    
        collide also tend to have the same step size, which leads to clustering. A    
        secondary hash breaks up this uniformity.
    - avoids collisions by computing a hash code that's a ``double`` instead of an    
      ``int``
