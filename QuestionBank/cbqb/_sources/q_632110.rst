    I have a number of different forms in my program, and have help topics    
    explaining how each should be used. When the users presses F1, I want the    
    appropriate help topic to appear depending on which form is currently open.    
    What is the easiest way to achieve this?    
    

    - Set the HelpContextID property of the Application object to the appropriate ID    
      value.    
      

      - The HelpContextID property is used to link a user interface element (such as a    
        control, form, or menu) to a related topic in a Help file. The HelpContextID    
        property must be a Long that matches the Context ID of a topic in a WinHelp    
        (.hlp) or HTML Help (.chm) file.

    - Set the HelpContextID property of each form to the appropriate ID value.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Set the HelpContext property of a Common Dialog control to the appropriate ID    
      value.

    - Rewrite the help as a number of different help files, one for each form. Use a    
      different HelpFile property for each form.
