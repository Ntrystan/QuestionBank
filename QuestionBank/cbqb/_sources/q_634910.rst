    Let's call the index at which an element is placed in an otherwise empty    
    hashtable index h. With open addressing, a key-value pair may collide with    
    another and be placed in a different location according to some defined    
    scheme. Where may a key-value pair be placed?    
    

    - anywhere in the array    
      

      + Correct!
    - at a list stored at index h    
      

      - With open addressing, some sort of probing algorithm is used to resolve    
        collisions. Probing involves stepping along from the collision index to a    
        subsequent element whose distance is determined by some step size. This    
        probing visits all elements of the array, if need be.
    - at index h or after
