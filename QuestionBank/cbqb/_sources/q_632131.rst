    What is output by the code shown below. Think about it carefully -it may be a    
    bit tricky!    
        
    void main( void )    
        
    {    
        
    static char szCode[] = "111";    
        
    szCode[2] = '0';    
        
    puts( szCode );    
        
    }    
    

    - Nothing    
      

      - The value of the character in the array at index [2] (where index starts from    
        0)  is set to zero and the other initialized array values remain unchanged
    - 011    
      

      - The value of the character in the array at index [2] (where index starts from    
        0)  is set to zero and the other initialized array values remain unchanged
    - 101    
      

      - The value of the character in the array at index [2] (where index starts from    
        0)  is set to zero and the other initialized array values remain unchanged
    - 110    
      

      + Correct!
    - 111    
      

      - The value of the character in the array at index [2] (where index starts from    
        0)  is set to zero and the other initialized array values remain unchanged
