    Finding the maximum value in a complete and balanced binary search tree is    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - The maximum is the root's right-most descendent, which can be reached in log N    
        steps.
    - O(log N)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(N)    
      

      - The maximum is the root's right-most descendent, which can be reached in log N    
        steps.
    - O(N2)    
      

      - The maximum is the root's right-most descendent, which can be reached in log N    
        steps.
    - O(N log N)    
      

      - The maximum is the root's right-most descendent, which can be reached in log N    
        steps.
