    Given the above binary tree rooted at Node A, what is the order of nodes    
    visited by a preorder search?    
    

    - A, B, C, D, E, F, G    
      

      - A preorder search of a tree is:  visit the root, visit the left subtree, visit    
        the right subtree.    
            
        It procedes as    
            
        Visit A    
            
        Visit left subtree:    
            
             Visit B (its root)    
            
             Visit its left subtree:    
            
                  Visit D    
            
             Visit its right subtree:    
            
                  Visit E    
            
        Visit right subtree:    
            
            Visit C (its root)    
            
            Visit its left subtree:    
            
                Visit F    
            
            Visit its right subtree:    
            
                Visit G    
            
        The order of nodes visited corresponds to answer B
    - A, B, D, E, C, F, G    
      

      + Correct!
    - D, B, E, A, F, C, G
