    Consider this code segment:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           boolean x = false;    
           boolean y = true;    
           boolean z = true;    
           System.out.println( (x || !y) && (!x || z) );    
        
    What value is printed?    
    

    - true    
      

      - Since `x` is false and `y` is true, `(x || !y)` is false.  This forces the    
        entire expression to be false, because of the `&&` operator.
    - false    
      

      + Correct!
    - Nothing, there is a syntax error    
      

      - Since `x` is false and `y` is true, `(x || !y)` is false.  This forces the    
        entire expression to be false, because of the `&&` operator.
