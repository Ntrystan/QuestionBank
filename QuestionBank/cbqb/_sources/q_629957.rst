    Suppose you have a Java array of ``int``\ s. Which of the following operations can    
    be performed in constant (O(1)) time? (Circle all correct answers.)    
    

    - Insert a number at a given position.    
      

      - **Note:  **Only one answer can be marked as correct here, but both A and B are    
        correct.    
            
        **Note 2:  **We need a new tag  SkillAnalyze-Code for this kind of thing.    
            
        C is incorrect because printing out all the numbers takes O(n) time.      
        D is incorrect because computing the sum of the numbers also takes O(n) time.      
        E is incorrect because while hashtables come close on average, in the worst    
        case, sorting is not O(1).      
        A is correct (assuming you don't have to move any of the numbers that are    
        already in the array).      
        B is correct.
    - Retrieve a number from a given position    
      

      + Correct!
    - Print out the numbers in the array    
      

      - **Note:  **Only one answer can be marked as correct here, but both A and B are    
        correct.

        C is incorrect because printing out all the numbers takes O(n) time.      
        D is incorrect because computing the sum of the numbers also takes O(n) time.      
        E is incorrect because while hashtables come close on average, in the worst    
        case, sorting is not O(1).      
        A is correct (assuming you don't have to move any of the numbers that are    
        already in the array).      
        B is correct.
    - Compute the sum of all the numbers in the array    
      

      - **Note:  **Only one answer can be marked as correct here, but both A and B are    
        correct.

        A is correct (assuming you don't have to move any of the numbers that are    
        already in the array).      
        B is correct.
    - Sort the numbers in the array
