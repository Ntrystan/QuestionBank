    Given the following Java class declaration:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class T2int    
           {    
               private int i;    
        
               public T2int()    
               {    
                   i = 0;    
               }    
        
               public T2int(int i)    
               {    
                   this.i = i;    
               }    
        
               public int get()    
               {    
                   return i;    
               }    
           }    
        
    The following method, called ``rangeSum()``\ , is intended to take three    
    parameters: a ``List`` of ``T2int`` objects, plus the ``low`` and ``high`` end of a    
    range within the list. The method computes the sum of the values in the ``List``    
    that are **within** the "range" (but **not including** the range end values).    
    Choose the best choice to fill in the blank on **Line 8**  so that the method    
    will work as intended:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public int rangeSum(List<T2int> list, int low, int high)    
           {    
               int num = 0;                                 // Line 1    
               int sum = 0;                                 // Line 2    
        
               for (int idx = 0; idx < list.size(); idx++)  // Line 3    
               {    
                   int ival = list.get(idx).get();          // Line 4    
                   if (__________)                          // Line 5    
                   {    
                       num++;                               // Line 6    
                       sum = __________;                    // Line 7    
                   }    
               }    
               return __________;                           // Line 8    
           }    
    

    - ``sum``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``num``    
      

      - The method should return the sum of all of the list elements that are within    
        the specified range.  From examining the body of the loop, it is clear that    
        this value is accumulated in the local variable `sum`.
    - ``ival``    
      

      - The method should return the sum of all of the list elements that are within    
        the specified range.  From examining the body of the loop, it is clear that    
        this value is accumulated in the local variable `sum`.
    - ``idx``    
      

      - The method should return the sum of all of the list elements that are within    
        the specified range.  From examining the body of the loop, it is clear that    
        this value is accumulated in the local variable `sum`.
    - ``list.get(num)``    
      

      - The method should return the sum of all of the list elements that are within    
        the specified range.  From examining the body of the loop, it is clear that    
        this value is accumulated in the local variable `sum`.
