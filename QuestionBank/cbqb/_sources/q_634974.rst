    What does the following Python method do?      
        
    Note: lov stands for list of values.    
        
    def foo (lov):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
        listSize = len(lov)\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
        current = 1\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
        flag = True\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
        while ((current < listSize) and flag):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
            if (lov[current] < lov[current-1]):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
                flag = False\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
            current = current + 1\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
        return (flag)    
    

    - Implements the sequential search algorithm.    
      

      - Flag is set to true and when two adjacent list items are found to be out of    
        place, with respect to a non-decreasing sorted order, flag is set to false.
    - Determines if the input list is sorted in ascending order.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Implements the selection sort algorithm.    
      

      - Flag is set to true and when two adjacent list items are found to be out of    
        place, with respect to a non-decreasing sorted order, flag is set to false.
    - Determines if the input list is sorted in descended order    
      

      - Flag is set to true and when two adjacent list items are found to be out of    
        place, with respect to a non-decreasing sorted order, flag is set to false.
    - None of the above    
      

      - Flag is set to true and when two adjacent list items are found to be out of    
        place, with respect to a non-decreasing sorted order, flag is set to false.
