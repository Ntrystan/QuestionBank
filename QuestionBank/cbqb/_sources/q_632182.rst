    How many times will the printf statement be executed in this piece of code?    
        
    In each case assume the definition    
        
    int i = 0;    
        
    WARNING There are some very nasty traps in some of the code here. LOOK AT IT    
    ALL VERY CAREFULLY!    
        
    for(i = 0; i <= 3; i++)    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        switch ( i )    
        
        {    
        
              case 0: puts("Case 0");    
        
              break;    
        
             case 1: puts("Case 1");    
        
             case 2: puts("Case 2");    
        
             default: printf("Count me!");    
        
        }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - 0    
      

      - The code iterates until the index reaches 3 (a total of four times) but on the    
        first iteration the case statement bresk before executing the printf function.    
        On subsequent iterations the printf fucntion is executed, twice by matching    
        the index values and once by default.

      + Correct!
    - an infinite number
