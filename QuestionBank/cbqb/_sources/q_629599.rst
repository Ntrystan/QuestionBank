    Using the information in the UML diagram above, suppose we execute the    
    following Java statements:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
                Vehicle vehicle = new OilTanker(2500);    
                vehicle.move();    
        
    which definition of ``move`` will be executed?    
    

    - The one defined in ``Truck``    
      

      - The code will not work
    - The one defined in ``Vehicle``    
      

      - The code will not work
    - The one defined in ``OilTanker``    
      

      + Correct!
    - The one defined in ``PeopleHauler``    
      

      - The code will not work
    - The code will not work    
      

      - The code will not work
