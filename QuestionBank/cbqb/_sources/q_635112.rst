    Consider this code segment:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           boolean x = false;    
           boolean y = true;    
           boolean z = true;    
           System.out.println( (x && !y || z) );    
        
    What value is printed?    
    

    - true    
      

      + Correct!
    - false    
      

      - Although `x` is false, and `!y` is also false, making `x && !y` evaluate to    
        false, the variable `z` is true, so the overall expression is true because of    
        the `||` operator.  Remember that `||` has lower precedence than `&&` in    
        boolean expressions.
    - nothing, there is a syntax error
