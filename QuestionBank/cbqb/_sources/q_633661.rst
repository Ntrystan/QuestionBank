    Which of these relationships best exemplify the "IS-A" relationships in    
    object-oriented programming (OOP)?    
    

    - Empire State Building IS-A Building    
      

      - A and C are wrong because the Empire State Building would be best be described    
        as an instance of the category Cuilding, while Angry Cat is an instance of the    
        category Cat.    
            
        B is correct because Cat is a sub-category of Mammal, which best exemplifies    
        the IS-A relations.  In OOP, the IS-A relationship is used to denote    
        relationships between classes, which are sort of like categories.
    - Cat IS-A Mammal    
      

      + Correct!
    - Angry Cat IS-A Cat    
          
      (Note that "Angry Cat" is a specific cat that has become an online internet    
      meme)    
      

      - A and C are wrong because the Empire State Building would be best be described    
        as an instance of the category Cuilding, while Angry Cat is an instance of the    
        category Cat.    
            
        B is correct because Cat is a sub-category of Mammal, which best exemplifies    
        the IS-A relations.  In OOP, the IS-A relationship is used to denote    
        relationships between classes, which are sort of like categories.
