    Consider this code segment:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           boolean x = false;    
           boolean y = true;    
           boolean z = true;    
           System.out.println( (!x || y && !z) );    
        
    What value is printed?    
    

    - true    
      

      + Correct!
    - false    
      

      - Since `x` is false, `!x` is true, forcing the entire expression to be true    
        because of the `||` operator.  Remember that `&&` has higher precedence than    
        `||` for grouping.
    - nothing, there is a syntax error
