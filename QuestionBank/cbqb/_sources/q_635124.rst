    Suppose you have an array of seven ``int`` values called ``test`` containing the    
    following data:    
        
        
    .. image:: img/23.png    
       :target: img/23.png    
       :alt: no description    
        
        
    Trace the execution of the following code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int x = 0;    
           int y = 0;    
           for (int i = 0; i < test.length; i++)    
           {    
               if (test[i] % 4 == 0)    
               {    
                   x++;    
                   y += test[i];    
               }    
           }    
        
    What is the value of ``x`` when this loop is done?    
    

    - 3    
      

      - The loop traverses the array from left to right, and the if statement    
        determines whether the corresponding value is evenly divisible by 4. The local    
        variable y is used to accumulate the sum of the numbers found, so y = 8 + 0 +    
        12 + 20 = 40.
    - 4

      + Correct!
