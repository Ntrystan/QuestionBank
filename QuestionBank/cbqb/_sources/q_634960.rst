    Given the above binary tree rooted at Node A, what is the order of nodes    
    visited by an inorder search?    
    

    - A, B, C, D, E, F, G    
      

      - An inorder search of a binary tree is: visit the left subtree, visit the root,    
        visit the right subtree.    
            
        It procedes as    
            
        Visit left subtree:    
            
             Visit its left subtree:    
            
                   Visit D    
            
             Visit B (its root)    
            
             Visit its right subtree:     
            
                   Visit E       
            
        Visit A (the root)    
            
        Visit right subtree:    
            
             Visit its left subtree:    
            
                  Visit F    
            
             Visit C (its root)    
            
             Visit its right subtree:    
            
                  Visit G
    - A, B, D, E, C, F, G    
      

      - An inorder search of a binary tree is: visit the left subtree, visit the root,    
        visit the right subtree.

        Visit left subtree:    
            
             Visit its left subtree:    
            
                   Visit D    
            
             Visit B (its root)    
            
             Visit its right subtree:     
            
                   Visit E       
            
        Visit A (the root)    
            
        Visit right subtree:    
            
             Visit its left subtree:    
            
                  Visit F    
            
             Visit C (its root)    
            
             Visit its right subtree:    
            
                  Visit G
    - D, B, E, A, F, C, G    
      

      + Correct!
    - D, E, B, F, G, C, A
