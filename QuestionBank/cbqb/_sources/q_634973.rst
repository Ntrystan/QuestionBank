    Suppose all of the computer's memory is available to you, and no other storage    
    is available. Every time your array is filled to its capacity, you enlarge it    
    by creating an array twice the size of the original, if sufficient memory is    
    available, and copying over all elements. How large can your growable array    
    get?    
    

    - 50% of memory    
      

      - When the array consumes 33% of memory and needs to expand, it can do so. The    
        new array will consume 66% of memory. After this, there is not enough room for    
        a larger array.
    - 100% of memory
