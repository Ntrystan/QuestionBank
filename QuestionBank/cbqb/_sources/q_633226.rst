    Many English words have separate singular and plural forms, e.g., "dog" and    
    "dogs." We are trying to write a method that properly pluralizes a word    
    (though naively, by only adding an "s" at the end) if the count we have of    
    that word is not 1. If the count is 1, we leave the word as is. Which of the    
    following proposed solutions does not meet this specification?    
    

    - [code]    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         String getCounted(String singular, int count) {    
           if (count != 1) {    
             return singular + "s";    
           } else {    
             return singular;    
           }    
         }    
          
          
      ```    
      

      - Suffix is initialized to null. The concatenation of singular and suffix does    
        not produce the desired behavior.

           String quantified = singular;    
           if (count != 1) {    
             quantified = quantified + "s";    
           }    
           return quantified;    
         }
