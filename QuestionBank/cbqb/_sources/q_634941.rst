    What is the base case for ``fib`` in the above definition?    
    

    - a    
      

      - The base case is the version of the problem that can be solved directly, i.e.    
        without a recursive call.
    - ``fib(a-1) + fib(a-2);``    
      

      - The base case is the version of the problem that can be solved directly, i.e.    
        without a recursive call.
    - ``fib(a)`` for ``a < 2``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``fib(a)`` for ``a â‰¥ 2``    
      

      - The base case is the version of the problem that can be solved directly, i.e.    
        without a recursive call.
    - None of the above    
      

      - The base case is the version of the problem that can be solved directly, i.e.    
        without a recursive call.
