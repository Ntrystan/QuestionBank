    Gianluca wants to sort the array array, which has a length of length. He    
    writes the following C code to do this. Which sorting algorithm has he    
    implemented?    
        
    ``void sort_array(int *array, int length)``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           {    
              int max, i, temp;    
              while(length > 0)    
              {    
                  max = 0;    
                  for(i = 1; i < length; i++)    
                      if(array[i] > array[max])    
                           max = i;    
                  temp = array[length-1];    
                  array[length-1] = array[max];    
                  array[max] = temp;    
                  length--;    
              }    
           }    
    

    - Insertion sort    
      

      - Students should take note that this code is looking for the max elements over    
        and over again.
    - Selection sort    
      

      + Correct!
    - Bubble sort    
      

      - Students should take note that this code is looking for the max elements over    
        and over again.
    - Mergesort    
      

      - Students should take note that this code is looking for the max elements over    
        and over again.
