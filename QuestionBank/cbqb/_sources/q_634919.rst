    Grace has written a method to pop from a stack; fill in the pre-condition.    
        
    ``struct node* pop(struct node **head)``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           {    
               // pops the stack pointed to by head; does nothing to alter that node    
               // PRE:    
               // POST: head now points to what was the second element of the list    
               struct node* to_pop = *head;    
               *head = (*head)->next;    
               return to_pop;    
           }    
    

    - head != NULL    
      

      - *head != NULL is the best answer of A-C as it has the closest level of detail to what is used in the code
    - *head != NULL    
      

      + Correct!
    - **head != NULL    
      

      - *head != NULL is the best answer of A-C as it has the closest level of detail to what is used in the code
    - to_pop != NULL    
      

      - *head != NULL is the best answer of A-C as it has the closest level of detail to what is used in the code
