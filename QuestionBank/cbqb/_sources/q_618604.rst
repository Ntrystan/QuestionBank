    Which part of the following code will produce a compiler error if we know    
    class cat extends a class called animal and both of the classes have a method    
    called makeNoise and class cat has a method called showFood.    
        
    1     animal mydog = new animal();    
        
    2     mydog.makeNoise();    
        
    3     animal mycat = new cat();    
        
    4     mycat.makeNoise();    
        
    5     mycat.showFood();    
    

    - line 3, new cat should be changed to new animal.    
      

      - line 4, makeNoise has not been recognized by mycat
    - line 3, animal should be changed to cat.    
      

      - line 4, makeNoise has not been recognized by mycat
    - line 4, makeNoise has not been recognized by mycat    
      

      - line 4, makeNoise has not been recognized by mycat
    - line 5, showFood has not been recognized by mycat
