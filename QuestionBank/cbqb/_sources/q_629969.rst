    Suppose you have a sorted list of numbers stored in a Java array of ints. What    
    is the worst-case time complexity of searching for a given number in the list    
    using binary search?    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - Binary search in a sorted array can be implemented in O(log n) time    
            
        **Note:  **It is likely that the instructor went over this in class. If so,    
        perhaps it should be tagged as Skill-Pure-Knowledge-Recall.
    - O(log n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(n)    
      

      - Binary search in a sorted array can be implemented in O(log n) time    
            
        **Note:  **It is likely that the instructor went over this in class. If so,    
        perhaps it should be tagged as Skill-Pure-Knowledge-Recall.
    - O(n log n)    
      

      - Binary search in a sorted array can be implemented in O(log n) time    
            
        **Note:  **It is likely that the instructor went over this in class. If so,    
        perhaps it should be tagged as Skill-Pure-Knowledge-Recall.
    - O(n2)    
      

      - Binary search in a sorted array can be implemented in O(log n) time    
            
        **Note:  **It is likely that the instructor went over this in class. If so,    
        perhaps it should be tagged as Skill-Pure-Knowledge-Recall.
