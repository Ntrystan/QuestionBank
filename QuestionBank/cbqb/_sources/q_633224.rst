    In Java, what does it mean if something is marked ``static``\ ?    
    

    - It never changes value.    
      

      - Something that is static is defined at the class level and is accessed through    
        the class, rather than through an instance.
    - It exists outside of any particular instance of the class.    
      

      + Correct!
    - It cannot be overridden.    
      

      - Something that is static is defined at the class level and is accessed through    
        the class, rather than through an instance.
    - Its value is undetermined.    
      

      - Something that is static is defined at the class level and is accessed through    
        the class, rather than through an instance.
    - It marks the program's starting point.    
      

      - Something that is static is defined at the class level and is accessed through
