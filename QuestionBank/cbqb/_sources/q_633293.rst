    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           in_str = input('Enter a string: ')    
           a = ''    
           d = 0    
           r = 1    
        
           for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':    
              if c in in_str:    
                 a = c + a    
              else:    
                 d = d + 1    
           r += 2    
        
           print(a) # Line 1    
           print(d) # Line 2    
           print(r) # Line 3    
        
    Given the input ``'Frick & Frack'`` what output is produced by Line 2?
