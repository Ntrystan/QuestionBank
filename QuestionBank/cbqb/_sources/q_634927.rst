    Given the following Java code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           if (x >= 0) {    
              System.out.println("1");    
           } else if (x < 20) {    
              System.out.println("2");    
           } else {    
              System.out.println("3");    
           }    
           System.out.println("4");    
        
    For what integer values of ``x`` will 1 be among the values printed?    
    

    - x < 0    
      

      - The first branch of the conditional statement will print "1" for any x value    
        greater than or equal to 0.
    - x >= 0    
      

      + Correct!
    - x >= 20    
      

      - The first branch of the conditional statement will print "1" for any x value    
        greater than or equal to 0.
    - All values of x    
      

      - The first branch of the conditional statement will print "1" for any x value    
        greater than or equal to 0.
    - None of the above.    
      

      - The first branch of the conditional statement will print "1" for any x value    
        greater than or equal to 0.
