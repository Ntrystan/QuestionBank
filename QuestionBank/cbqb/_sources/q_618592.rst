    Where in this code a compiler error is reported and why?    
        
    1  class pen{    
        
    2         char colorCode;    
        
    3  }    
        
    4  public class penCounter {    
        
    5         public static void main(String[] arg){    
        
    6                    int numberOfPen;    
        
    7                    pen myPen = new pen();    
        
    8                   System.out.println(myPen.colorCode + numberOfPen);    
        
    9         }
