    Using the information in the UML diagram above, suppose some method of ``Truck``    
    has the line ``super.move()``. Which of these is true?    
    

    - The ``move`` method defined in ``Truck`` is executed when that line is executed.    
      

      - None of the above
    - The\ ``move`` method defined in ``Vehicle`` is executed when that line is executed.    
      

      - None of the above
    - It depends on whether ``move()`` is defined in ``Vehicle``\ 's superclass    
      

      - None of the above
    - The code will not compile, so I cannot run it.    
      

      + Correct!
    - None of the above
