    Consider the following partial and incomplete ``SpellChecker`` class that uses    
    an ``ArrayList`` to hold a reference list of correctly-spelled words:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class SpellChecker    
           {    
               private List<String> dictionary;   // spelling storage.    // Line 1    
        
               // assume a constructor exists that correctly instantiates and    
               // populates the list (i.e. loads the dictionary for the spellchecker)    
        
               public boolean spelledCorrectly(String word)               // Line 2    
               {    
                   for (int counter = 0; counter < __________; counter++) // Line 3    
                   {    
                       if (word.equals(__________))                       // Line 4    
                       {    
                           return true;                                   // Line 5    
                       }    
                   }    
                   return false;                                          // Line 6    
               }    
        
               public void addWord(String word)                           // Line 7    
               {    
                   if (__________) // check word is NOT already in the dictionary // Line 8    
                   {    
                       __________; // add word at end of the dictionary   // Line 9    
                   }    
               }    
        
               // other SpellChecker class methods would follow    
           }    
        
    Choose the best choice to fill in the blank on line 3 so that the code    
    operates correctly.    
    

    - ``dictionary.size()``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``dictionary.length()``    
      

      - The loop in `spelledCorrectly()` checks each word in the list called    
        `dictionary` for the specified word, so the upper limit on the loop counter    
        should be `dictionary.size()`.  Remember that lists provide a `size()` method    
        to retrieve the number of entries (the `length()` method is used for strings,    
        and `length` as a field access is used for arrays).
    - ``dictionary.size``    
      

      - The loop in `spelledCorrectly()` checks each word in the list called
