    Suppose we have a Queue implemented with a circular array. The ``capacity`` is    
    10 and the ``size`` is 5.    
        
    Which are *not* legal values for ``front`` and ``rear``\ ?    
    

    - front: 0    
          
      rear:  5    
      

      - There would only be 4 items in this queue, not 5.  This is easier to    
        illustrate with a picture.  But you can sort of see the pattern by looking at    
        the absolute value of the difference betwen all of the pairings.  B is the    
        only one that differs by 4; the others all differ by 5.
    - front: 5    
          
      rear:  9    
      

      + Correct!
    - front: 7    
          
      rear:  2

    - all of the above
