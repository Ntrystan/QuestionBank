    This Perl script does not work correctly. It is supposed to work out the    
    average assessment mark for a student who has 6 marked exercises.    
        
    Whatever data the student enters, the script always displays an average mark    
    of zero.    
        
    Note that line numbers have been added for reference only - they are not part    
    of the script    
        
    1 my $total = 0;    
        
    2    
        
    3 for(my $mk = 1; $mk <= 6; $mk++)    
        
    4 {    
        
    5     print "Enter mark $mk: ";    
        
    6     my $mark = :raw-html-m2r:`<STDIN>`\ ;    
        
    7     my $total += $mark;    
        
    8 }    
        
    9    
        
    10 my $average = $total / 6;    
        
    11 print "Average mark = $average.\n";    
        
    What is the problem?    
    

    - <= 6 on line 3 should be <    
      

      - A my declares the listed variables to be local (lexically) to the enclosing    
        block, file, or eval.    
            
        source http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/my.html    
            
        Therefore the accumulated value of $total is not available to the following    
        block where the average is calculated
    - The my on line 6 should not be there.    
      

      - A my declares the listed variables to be local (lexically) to the enclosing    
        block, file, or eval.    
            
        source http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/my.html    
            
        Therefore the accumulated value of $total is not available to the following    
        block where the average is calculated
    - The my on line 7 should not be there.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Line 10 should show $mark / 6.    
      

      - A my declares the listed variables to be local (lexically) to the enclosing    
        block, file, or eval.    
            
        source http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/my.html    
            
        Therefore the accumulated value of $total is not available to the following    
        block where the average is calculated
    - A <= 6 on line 3 should be <    
          
      B The my on line 6 should not be there.    
          
      C The my on line 7 should not be there.    
          
      D Line 10 should show $mark / 6.
