    Which statement or statements store 0.8 into the variable ``d`` of type    
    ``double``\ ?    
    

    - double d=8/10;    
      

      - A is wrong because 8/10 is zero.  But the B,C,D (8.0/10.0, 8/10.0, 8.0/10) all    
        produce 0.8 because Java will promote any ints to a double in an arithmetic    
        expression so long as there is at least one double in the expression.
    - double d=8.0/10.0;    
      

      + Correct!

    - None of the above
