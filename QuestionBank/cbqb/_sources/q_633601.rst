    What does the following Java code print?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int outer=0;    
           int inner=0;    
           for (int i=0; i<6; i++) {    
              outer++;    
              for (int j=0; j<=i; j++) {    
                 inner++;    
              }    
           }    
           System.out.println("outer "+outer+", inner "+inner);    
    

    - outer 6, inner i    
      

      - The inner loop is based on the current iteration of the outer loop.  If we    
        track the values:    
            
        outer 0, inner 0    
            
        outer 1, inner 0,1    
            
        outer 2, inner 0,1,2    
            
        and so on up to 6.    
            
        If we add up all of the inner values, there are 21 of them.    
            
        This is the classic "triangle" pattern, because the inner values proceed like    
        this:    
            
        0    
            
        0 1    
            
        0 1 2    
            
        0 1 2 3    
            
        0 1 2 3 4    
            
        0 2 3 4 4 5
    - outer 6, inner 24

        outer 1, inner 0,1    
            
        outer 2, inner 0,1,2    
            
        and so on up to 6.

        0 1 2 3 4    
            
        0 2 3 4 4 5
    - outer 6, inner 21    
      

      + Correct!
    - outer 24, inner 24
