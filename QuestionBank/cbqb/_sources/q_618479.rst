    What is wrong with this code?    
        
    final class A{    
        
    }    
        
    class B extends A{    
        
    }    
    

    - Class B is not public.    
      

      - A final class cannot be extended.
    - Class A is not public.    
      

      - A final class cannot be extended.
    - A final class cannot be extended.    
      

      + Correct!
    - There are no instance variables and methods defined for these classes.    
      

      - A final class cannot be extended.
