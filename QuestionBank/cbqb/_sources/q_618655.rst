    A compiler error existed in this code. Why is that happening?    
        
    public class test {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        int testCount;    
        
        public static int getCount(){    
        
             return testCount;    
        
        }    
        
        public test(){    
        
            testCount ++;    
        
        }    
        
        
    }    
    

    - testCount has not been initialized.    
      

      - testCount as a non-static variable cannot be referenced in a static method    
        such as getCount() .
    - testCount has never been used.    
      

      - testCount as a non-static variable cannot be referenced in a static method    
        such as getCount() .
    - testCount as a non-static variable cannot be referenced in a static method    
      such as getCount() .    
      

      + Correct!
    - testCount's access modifier is not public.    
      

      - testCount as a non-static variable cannot be referenced in a static method    
        such as getCount() .
