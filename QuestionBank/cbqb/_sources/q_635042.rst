    The *scope* of a variable in Java is:    
    

    - The thing that allows it to see other variables;    
      

      - The scope of a variable is the part of the program in which that variable can    
        be referred to by its name.  A private instance variable in a class    
        definition, for example, can only be referred to within that class definition.
    - The other variables that it can interact with    
      

      - The scope of a variable is the part of the program in which that variable can    
        be referred to by its name.  A private instance variable in a class    
        definition, for example, can only be referred to within that class definition.
    - The part of the program in which it can be used    
      

      + Correct!
    - One of its instance variables    
      

      - The scope of a variable is the part of the program in which that variable can    
        be referred to by its name.  A private instance variable in a class    
        definition, for example, can only be referred to within that class definition.
    - None of the above    
      

      - The scope of a variable is the part of the program in which that variable can    
        be referred to by its name.  A private instance variable in a class
