    Consider this section of code.    
        
    int a = 3, b = 4, c = 5;    
        
    x = a * b <= c    
        
    The expression contains an arithmetic operator, an assignment operator and a    
    relational operator. Which is which?    
    

    - Arithmetic Assignment Relational    
          
      .. code-block::    
          
         =                   *                    <=    
      

      - operators are: multiply, assignment and less than or equal
    - Arithmetic Assignment Relational    
          
          
      * <=                  =    
      

      - operators are: multiply, assignment and less than or equal
    - Arithmetic Assignment Relational    
          
      <=                 *                     =    
      

      - operators are: multiply, assignment and less than or equal
    - Arithmetic Assignment Relational    
          
          
      * =                    <=    
      

      + Correct!
    - Arithmetic Assignment Relational    
          
       <=                  =                   *    
      

      - operators are: multiply, assignment and less than or equal
