    Before testing an executable version of your program with data from a test    
    file using DOS redirection, you should remove all calls to fflush from your    
    program. Why is this necessary?    
    

    - fflush is not part of the ANSI C standard.    
      

      - fflush would read and ignore all remaining data in the test file, as it has    
        already flushed the input buffer
    - fflush is for debugging only. It causes a run time error in an exe file.    
      

      - fflush would read and ignore all remaining data in the test file, as it has    
        already flushed the input buffer
    - fflush would read and ignore all remaining data in the test file.    
      

      + Correct!
    - fflush is not in any QuickC library.    
      

      - fflush would read and ignore all remaining data in the test file, as it has    
        already flushed the input buffer
    - fflush does not echo output to the screen.    
      

      - fflush would read and ignore all remaining data in the test file, as it has    
        already flushed the input buffer
