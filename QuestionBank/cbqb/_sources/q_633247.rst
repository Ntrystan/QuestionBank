    Two algorithms accomplish the same task on a collection of N items. Algorithm    
    A performs log2 N operations. Algorithm B performs log3 N operations. Under    
    what conditions does algorithm A offer better performance?    
    

    - N <= 2    
      

      - For no possible collection size N is log2 N < log3 N.
    - N < log2 3    
      

      - For no possible collection size N is log2 N < log3 N.
    - N < log3 2    
      

      - For no possible collection size N is log2 N < log3 N.
    - N < 8    
      

      - For no possible collection size N is log2 N < log3 N.
    - For no N.    
      

      + Correct!
