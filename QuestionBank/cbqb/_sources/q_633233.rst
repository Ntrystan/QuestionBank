    What is printed when the following program runs?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class Main {    
             public static boolean getTrue() {    
               System.out.print("T");    
               return true;    
             }    
        
             public static boolean getFalse() {    
               System.out.print("F");    
               return false;    
             }    
        
             public static void main(String[] args) {    
               getTrue() && getFalse();    
             }    
           }    
    

    - T    
      

      - The first operand is true. && requires both operands be true, so we evaluate    
        the second, which is false.
    - TT    
      

      - The first operand is true. && requires both operands be true, so we evaluate    
        the second, which is false.
    - TF    
      

      + Correct!
    - F    
      

      - The first operand is true. && requires both operands be true, so we evaluate    
        the second, which is false.
    - Nothing is printed.    
      

      - The first operand is true. && requires both operands be true, so we evaluate    
        the second, which is false.
