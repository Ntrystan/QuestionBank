    Select the best choice to fill in the blank on line 4 in this method to    
    produce the correct behavior.    
    

    - ``return 0;``    
      

      - The test on line 3 checks a special case where the loop is never needed--when    
        both the `n` passed in and the digit being search for are both zero.  In this    
        situation, the result of the method should be 1.
    - ``return 1;``    
      

      + Correct!
    - ``return n;``    
      

      - The test on line 3 checks a special case where the loop is never needed--when    
        both the `n` passed in and the digit being search for are both zero.  In this    
        situation, the result of the method should be 1.
    - ``return d;``    
      

      - The test on line 3 checks a special case where the loop is never needed--when    
        both the `n` passed in and the digit being search for are both zero.  In this    
        situation, the result of the method should be 1.
    - ``return count;``    
      

      - The test on line 3 checks a special case where the loop is never needed--when    
        both the `n` passed in and the digit being search for are both zero.  In this
