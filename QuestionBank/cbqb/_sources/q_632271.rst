    Which data structure can be used to implement an abstract datatype such as the    
    StackADT or QueueADT?    
    

    - an array    
      

      - StackADT and QueueADT can both be implemented with either an array or a stack.    
        Either may be the better choice, depending on the purpose of the program and    
        the nature of the data being stored.
    - a linked list    
      

      - StackADT and QueueADT can both be implemented with either an array or a stack.    
        Either may be the better choice, depending on the purpose of the program and    
        the nature of the data being stored.
    - both    
      

      + Correct!
    - neither    
      

      - StackADT and QueueADT can both be implemented with either an array or a stack.    
        Either may be the better choice, depending on the purpose of the program and
