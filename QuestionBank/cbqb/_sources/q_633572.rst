    You've got a ``byte`` variable holding the value 127. You add 1 with ``byte +=    
    1``. What happens?    
    

    - It becomes a short with value 128.    
      

      - When you exceed the maximum value of an integral type, you wrap around to    
        other extreme. Bytes range from -128 to 127.
    - An OverflowException is raised.    
      

      - When you exceed the maximum value of an integral type, you wrap around to    
        other extreme. Bytes range from -128 to 127.
    - It remains a byte and stays at the value 127.    
      

      - When you exceed the maximum value of an integral type, you wrap around to    
        other extreme. Bytes range from -128 to 127.
    - It remains a byte and takes on the value -128.    
      

      + Correct!
    - It remains a byte and takes on the value 0.    
      

      - When you exceed the maximum value of an integral type, you wrap around to    
        other extreme. Bytes range from -128 to 127.
