    What does the following Java code print?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int inner=0;    
           int outer=0;    
           for (int i=0; i<6; i++) {    
              outer++;    
              for (int j=0; j<=3; j++) {    
                 inner++;    
              }    
           }    
           System.out.println("outer "+outer+", inner"+inner);    
    

    - outer 6, inner 3    
      

      - For nested loops, the inner loop runs to completion one time for each    
        iteration of the outer loop.  So if the outer loop executes 6 times, that    
        means the inner loop, which normally executes its loop body 4 times, will    
        actually run the loop body 24 times (4 executes times 6 outer executions).  I    
        probably could explain that better.
    - outer 7, inner 4

      + Correct!
