    Which one of the following is a limitation of Java's arrays?    
    

    - They can only hold primitive types.    
      

      - Arrays hold primitives and references, have a builtin length property, and    
        allow modification of individual elements. They cannot be resized.
    - They can only hold reference types.    
      

      - Arrays hold primitives and references, have a builtin length property, and    
        allow modification of individual elements. They cannot be resized.
    - Once an element is assigned, that element cannot be modified.    
      

      - Arrays hold primitives and references, have a builtin length property, and    
        allow modification of individual elements. They cannot be resized.
    - Their length must be stored separately.    
      

      - Arrays hold primitives and references, have a builtin length property, and    
        allow modification of individual elements. They cannot be resized.
    - They cannot change size.    
      

      + Correct!
