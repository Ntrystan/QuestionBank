    Chengcheng has an array that he would like to sort, and implements the    
    following sorting\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    method in C. Which sorting algorithm is this? (code is adapted from    
    http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_implementation)    
        
    ``void sort_array(int a[], int length)``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           {    
               // sorts the array a[], of length "length"    
               int i, j, value;    
               for(i = 1; i < length; i++)    
               {    
                   value = a[i];    
                   for (j = i - 1; j >= 0 && a[j] > value; j--)    
                   {    
                       a[j + 1] = a[j];    
                   }    
                   a[j + 1] = value;    
               }    
           }    
    

    - Insertion Sort    
      

      + Correct!
    - Selection Sort    
      

      - The code is working from one end of the array to the other, sorting as it    
        goes.
    - Bubble sort    
      

      - The code is working from one end of the array to the other, sorting as it    
        goes.
    - Mergesort    
      

      - The code is working from one end of the array to the other, sorting as it
