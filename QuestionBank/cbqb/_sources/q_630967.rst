    Suppose you are writing a program for a robot that will go around a building    
    and clean the floor. Your program will contain, among other things, a Robot    
    class and a Building class (with information about the layout of the    
    building). The Building class is also used in a different program for    
    scheduling maintenance of various parts of the building.    
        
    The relationship between your Robot class and your Building class is best    
    modeled as:    
    

    - a class-subclass relationship    
      

      - A and B are wrong, because a Building object doesn't share all the properties    
        and behaviors of a Robot object (or vice versa). D is wrong because the    
        Building object is not part of the Robot object (unlike the Robot's wheels,    
        for example). The two classes are sometimes part of different programs and    
        sometimes work together -- a peer relationship.

      + Correct!
    - a whole-component relationship
