    A coworker suggests that when you delete a node from a hashtable that you just    
    set it to null. What is your response?    
    

    - Yes, that way the garbage collector can reclaim the memory.    
      

      - When using probing to resolve collisions, the probing algorithm walks along    
        the probing sequence until it finds a null element. If nulls appear in the    
        wrong places, probing may terminate earlier than it should.
    - Yes, that will speed up probing.

    - No, the user may have alias references to the node.

    - No, doing so may make other nodes irretrievable.    
      

      + Correct!
