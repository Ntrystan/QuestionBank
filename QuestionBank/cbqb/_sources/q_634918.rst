    Suppose QueueADT is implemented using a singly linked list. What is the lowest    
    Big-Oh time complexity that can be achieved for an enqueue method?:    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(log2 n)    
      

      - If you keep a pointer to the last element of the queue, then the enqueue    
        method just needs a fixed number of statements, which are the same independent    
        of the size of the queue.
    - O(n)    
      

      - If you keep a pointer to the last element of the queue, then the enqueue    
        method just needs a fixed number of statements, which are the same independent    
        of the size of the queue.
    - O(n2)    
      

      - If you keep a pointer to the last element of the queue, then the enqueue    
        method just needs a fixed number of statements, which are the same independent    
        of the size of the queue.
    - none of the above    
      

      - If you keep a pointer to the last element of the queue, then the enqueue    
        method just needs a fixed number of statements, which are the same independent    
        of the size of the queue.
