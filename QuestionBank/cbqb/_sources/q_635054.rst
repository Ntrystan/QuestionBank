    Is a O(n log2 n) algorithm **ALWAYS** preferable over an O(n2) algorithm?      
    

    - False    
      

      + Correct!
    - True    
      

      - The correct answer is False, since one does not know the coeeficients for the    
        two algorithms, nor the specific value for n.  (e.g. .00001n2 vs 99999n log2    
        n).  Certainly, no matter what the coefficients are, when n is sufficiently    
        large, the quadratic algorithm will eventually become less efficient.
