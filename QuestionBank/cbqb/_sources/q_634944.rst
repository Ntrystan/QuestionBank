    For the Insertion sort algorithm; what is its best case and worst case    
    performance?    
    

    - Best: O(n)    
          
      Worst: O(n2)    
      

      + Correct!
    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      Best: O(n)\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      Worst: O(n)    
      

      - Insertion sort, if given an already sorted list, will still perform O(n)    
        comparisons to ascertain the list is sorted.  If the list is "reverse sorted,"    
        then the  first pass will require 1 exchange.  The second pass will require 2    
        exchanges, etc.  Hence, in the worst case, O(n2) exchanges.

      Worst: O(n2)

    - None of the above.
