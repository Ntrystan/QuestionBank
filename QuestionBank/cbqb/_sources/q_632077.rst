    Consider the following short program, which does not meet all institutional    
    coding standards:    
        
    void vCodeString(char szText[ ]); /\ * First line *\ /    
        
    include <stdio.h>    
    =================    
        
    include <string.h>    
    ==================    
        
    define MAX_LEN 12    
    =================    
        
    int main(void)    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        char szData[MAX_LEN];    
        
        printf("Enter some text to code: ");    
        
        scanf("%s", szData);    
        
        vCodeString(szData); /* Line 8 */    
        
        printf("Coded string is %s\n", szData);    
        
        
    }    
        
    void vCodeString(char szText[ ])    
        
    {    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        int i = -1;    
        
        while(szText[++i])    
        
        {    
        
             szText[i] += (char)2;    
        
        }    
        
        
    }    
        
    Knowing that scanf does not read beyond a space in the input, I try the    
    routine by typing in Hello there when it asks me for some text. What is output    
    after "Coded string is "?    
    

    - Nothing    
      

      - The vCodeString function converts the input by incrementing the next two    
        alphabetical letters for each character passed to it from the szData array    
        containing the the "hello" substring after which the scanf function had haled    
        on meeting the delimiting space character
    - Hello    
      

      - The vCodeString function converts the input by incrementing the next two    
        alphabetical letters for each character passed to it from the szData array    
        containing the the "hello" substring after which the scanf function had haled    
        on meeting the delimiting space character
    - Hello there    
      

      - The vCodeString function converts the input by incrementing the next two    
        alphabetical letters for each character passed to it from the szData array    
        containing the the "hello" substring after which the scanf function had haled    
        on meeting the delimiting space character
    - Jgnnq vjgtg

    - Jgnnq    
      

      + Correct!
