        result, they may not contain constructors.

      + Correct!
    - Must not include method implementations    
      

      - Interfaces cannot be instantiated and cannot contain method bodies.  As a    
        result, they may not contain constructors.
    - A class may implement more than one interface    
      

      - Interfaces cannot be instantiated and cannot contain method bodies.  As a    
        result, they may not contain constructors.
    - None of these
