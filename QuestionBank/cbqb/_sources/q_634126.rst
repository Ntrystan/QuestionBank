    What will this code output on a 64-bit machine?    
        
    ``int vals[10];``    
        
    ``printf("%d\n", sizeof(vals + 0));``    
    

    - 4    
      

      - sizeof(vals + 0) will get the size of the memory address of the first element    
        in vals; a pointer is 8 bytes on the 64-bit machine
    - 8    
      

      + Correct!
    - 40    
      

      - sizeof(vals + 0) will get the size of the memory address of the first element    
        in vals; a pointer is 8 bytes on the 64-bit machine
    - 80    
      

      - sizeof(vals + 0) will get the size of the memory address of the first element    
        in vals; a pointer is 8 bytes on the 64-bit machine
