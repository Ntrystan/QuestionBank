    GIven the "standard" set of Stack methods, what would ``fred.pop()`` return?    
    

    - A Node whose element is a blue Car    
      

      - Pop removes the most-recently pushed element from the Stack and returns it.    
        What it returns is specified by the interface, which is independent of    
        implementation.  A user should be able to interact with a stack using push,    
        pop, peek, and isEmpty without knowing the implementation details.
    - A Node whose element is a red Car    
      

      - Pop removes the most-recently pushed element from the Stack and returns it.    
        What it returns is specified by the interface, which is independent of    
        implementation.  A user should be able to interact with a stack using push,    
        pop, peek, and isEmpty without knowing the implementation details.
    - A blue Car    
      

      + Correct!
    - A red Car    
      

      - Pop removes the most-recently pushed element from the Stack and returns it.    
        What it returns is specified by the interface, which is independent of    
        implementation.  A user should be able to interact with a stack using push,    
        pop, peek, and isEmpty without knowing the implementation details.
    - A Stack that contains the remaining Car    
      

      - Pop removes the most-recently pushed element from the Stack and returns it.    
        What it returns is specified by the interface, which is independent of    
        implementation.  A user should be able to interact with a stack using push,    
        pop, peek, and isEmpty without knowing the implementation details.
