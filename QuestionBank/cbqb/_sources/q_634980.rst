    Which of the following statements about binary search algorithms is FALSE?    
    

    - The data must be sorted.    
      

      - Binary search takes ![](img/20.png)(log n) time, worst case.
    - There must be a mechanism to access elements in the middle of the data    
      structure.    
      

      - Binary search takes ![](img/20.png)(log n) time, worst case.

      - Binary search takes ![](img/20.png)(log n) time, worst case.
    - Binary search can be implemented to take     
      .. image:: img/19.png    
         :target: img/19.png    
         :alt:
