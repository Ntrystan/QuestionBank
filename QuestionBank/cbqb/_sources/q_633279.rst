    Which of the following makes an appropriate pre-condition for this code?\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    double calculate_percentage(double sum, double n)\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    ``{``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
               // calculates and returns a percentage given a sum and a length (n)    
               // <missing pre-condition>    
               // POST: none    
               return (sum / n) * 100;    
           }    
    

    - PRE: sum < 100    
      

      - The code will faill if n = 0, as it will divide by 0.
    - PRE: n != 0    
      

      + Correct!
    - PRE: sum != NULL and n != NULL    
      

      - The code will faill if n = 0, as it will divide by 0.
    - PRE: none    
      

      - The code will faill if n = 0, as it will divide by 0.
