    Consider the code below; what value will i have at the end of the code?    
        
    ``int *p, i;``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
            i = 3;    
            p = &i;    
            (*p)++;    
            i++;    
    

    - 3    
      

      - i is incremented twice, once through p
    - 4    
      

      - i is incremented twice, once through p
    - 5    
      

      + Correct!
    - 6    
      

      - i is incremented twice, once through p
    - 8    
      

      - i is incremented twice, once through p
