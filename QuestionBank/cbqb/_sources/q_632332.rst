    This Perl subroutine does not work correctly. It is supposed to work out    
    whether or not a person qualifies for a discount and return the correct fare,    
    discounted or not as the case may be. Children under 13, and elderly people 65    
    and over qualify for a discount.    
        
    The subroutine never gives a discount    
        
    Note that line numbers have been added for reference only - they are not part    
    of the script    
        
    1 sub getDiscount    
        
    2 {    
        
    3   my $age = $_[0]; # First parameter is age    
        
    4   my $fare = $_[1]; # Second parameter is fare    
        
    5    
        
    6   if(($age < 13) && ($age >= 65))    
        
    7   {    
        
    8   $fare *= 0.9; # 10% discount    
        
    9   }    
        
    11    
        
    12   return $fare;    
        
    13 }    
        
    What is the problem?    
    

    - $\ * on lines 3 and 4 should be @*.    
      

      - No age can be less than 13 AND 65 and over. It should be OR.
    - The and (&&) on line 6 should be an or (||)..    
      

      + Correct!
    - On line 6, the < should be replaced by <=.    
      

      - No age can be less than 13 AND 65 and over. It should be OR.
    - The return statement on line 12 should return $_[0].    
      

      - No age can be less than 13 AND 65 and over. It should be OR.
