    The following code for a method "minVal" contains a logic error on a single    
    line in the method body, on one of the four lines indicated by comments:      
        
    ``public static int minVal(int[] y, int first, int last) {``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           /* This method returns the value of the minimum element in the    
            * subsection of the array "y", starting at position    
            * "first" and ending at position "last".    
            */    
        
             int bestSoFar = first;             // line 1    
        
             for (int i=first+1; i<=last; i++)    
             {

    ``bestSoFar = y[i];             // line 3``      
        
    ``} // for``      
        
    ``return bestSoFar;                  // line 4``      
        
    ``} // method minVal``      
        
    Which one of the four lines indicated by the comments contains the logic    
    error?    
    

    - line 1    
      

      - line 2 should be `if ( y[i] < bestSoFar )`    
            
        `The > sign in this buggy line is looking for the MAXIMUM value in the array.`
    - line 2    
      

      + Correct!
    - line 3    
      

      - line 2 should be `if ( y[i] < bestSoFar )`    
            
        `The > sign in this buggy line is looking for the MAXIMUM value in the array.`
    - line4    
      

      - line 2 should be `if ( y[i] < bestSoFar )`    
            
        `The > sign in this buggy line is looking for the MAXIMUM value in the array.`
