    The code fragment given above was intended to read values until a negative    
    value was read and then to print the product of the positive values read.    
    Unfortunately, it does not work.    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           1.  Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in);    
           2.  int x, product;    
           3.  product = 0;    
           4.  x = kbd.nextInt();    
           5.  while (x >= 0) {    
           6.     if (x > 0) {    
           7.        product *= x;    
           8.     }    
           9.     x = kbd.nextInt();    
           10. }    
           11. System.out.println(product);    
        
    Which of the following best describes the error that prevents the code from    
    computing the correct answer?    
    

    - Variable ``x`` is not initialized correctly.    
      

      - Because the variable `product` is initialized to 0 instead of 1, the answer    
        will always be 0.
    - Variable ``product`` is not initialized correctly.    
      

      + Correct!
    - The loop is executed one too many times.    
      

      - Because the variable `product` is initialized to 0 instead of 1, the answer    
        will always be 0.
    - The loop is executed one two few times.    
      

      - Because the variable `product` is initialized to 0 instead of 1, the answer    
        will always be 0.
    - None of the above.    
      

      - Because the variable `product` is initialized to 0 instead of 1, the answer    
        will always be 0.
