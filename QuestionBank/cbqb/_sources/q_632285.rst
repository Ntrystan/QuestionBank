    Suppose ``StackADT`` is implemented in Java using a linked list. The big-Oh time    
    complexity of the following ``pop`` method is:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public T pop() {    
              T tmp;    
              if (this.top == null)     
                 tmp = null;    
              else {    
                 tmp = this.top.getElement();    
                 this.top = this.top.getNext();    
              }    
              return tmp;    
           }    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      + Correct!
    - O(log n)    
      

      - These operations can be done in constant time, independent of the size of the    
        stack.
    - O(n)    
      

      - These operations can be done in constant time, independent of the size of the    
        stack.
    - O(n2)    
      

      - These operations can be done in constant time, independent of the size of the    
        stack.
    - O(2n)    
      

      - These operations can be done in constant time, independent of the size of the    
        stack.
