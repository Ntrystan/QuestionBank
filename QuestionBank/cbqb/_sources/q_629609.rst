    Suppose you're on a project that is writing a large program. One of the    
    programmers is implementing a ``Clock`` class; the other programmers are writing    
    classes that will use the ``Clock`` class. Which of the following aspects of the    
    ``public`` methods of the ``Clock`` class do **not** need to be known by both the    
    author of the ``Clock`` class and the programmers who are using the ``Clock``    
    class?    
    

    - The methods' names    
      

      - This question addresses the principle of encapsulation. All these items must    
        be known to the author of the `Clock` class. In order to use the class, the    
        other programmers must know what the methods do, and must know their names,    
        parameter types, and return values. The method bodies, on the other hand, are    
        hidden from the users.
    - The methods' return types
