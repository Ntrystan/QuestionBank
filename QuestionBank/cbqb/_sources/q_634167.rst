    Fill in the single missing line of code:\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    ``int p, *r, **q;``

           p = 27;    
           r = &p;    
        
    // MISSING LINE\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    ``printf("The value is %d", **q); // prints 27.``    
    

    - *q = *\ r;    
      

      - B gets q to point to r, which points to p.
    - q = &r;    
      

      + Correct!
    - **q = p;    
      

      - B gets q to point to r, which points to p.
    - q = &&p;    
      

      - B gets q to point to r, which points to p.
    - *q = *\ p;    
      

      - B gets q to point to r, which points to p.
