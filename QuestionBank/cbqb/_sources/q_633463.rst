    What does the following Java code print?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int sum=0;    
           for (int i=0; i>100; i++) {    
              sum += i;    
           }    
           System.out.println(sum);    
    

    - 0    
      

      + Correct!
    - 100    
      

      - This is a trick question!  The stop condition of the for loop is i>100, and    
        since i starts at 0, i is never > 100, so the loop immediately ends.
    - 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 99 + 100

    - none of the above
