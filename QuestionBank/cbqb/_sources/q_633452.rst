    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           number = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))    
           while number > 1:    
              if (number % 2 == 1):    
                 number = number * 3 + 1    
              else:    
                 number = number/2    
              print number    
              if number == 1:    
                 break    
              else:    
                 print "The end"    
        
    Given the input '8', what output is produced by the program?    
    

    - an error    
      

      - Basically just trace the code.
    - 'The end'    
      

      - Basically just trace the code.
    - 4    
          
      2    
          
      1    
      

      + Correct!
    - 4    
          
      2    
          
      1    
          
      The end    
      

      - Basically just trace the code.
    - none of the above    
      

      - Basically just trace the code.
