    Which of the following is **not** a reason why wall clock time is a poor    
    measure of an algorithm's performance?    
    

    - It's dependent on processor speed.    
      

      - Wall clock time is a measure of real elapsed time between two events, which is    
        no different from one computer to the next.
    - Other programs may interrupt the one being measured.    
      

      - Wall clock time is a measure of real elapsed time between two events, which is    
        no different from one computer to the next.
    - The input cases may not capture the worst case running time.    
      

      - Wall clock time is a measure of real elapsed time between two events, which is    
        no different from one computer to the next.
    - Different platforms measure wall clock time differently.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Subsequent runs may read data from cache instead of disk.    
      

      - Wall clock time is a measure of real elapsed time between two events, which is    
        no different from one computer to the next.
