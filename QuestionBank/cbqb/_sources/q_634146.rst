    Depth-first traversal is kind of like selection sort, in the same way that    
    breadth-first traversal is like what sorting algorithm?    
    

    - Radix sort    
      

      - Insertion sort is breadth-first-like as you keep increasing the "breadth" of    
        the array that is sorted.
    - Bubblesort    
      

      - Insertion sort is breadth-first-like as you keep increasing the "breadth" of    
        the array that is sorted.
    - Heapsort    
      

      - Insertion sort is breadth-first-like as you keep increasing the "breadth" of    
        the array that is sorted.
    - Quicksort    
      

      - Insertion sort is breadth-first-like as you keep increasing the "breadth" of    
        the array that is sorted.
    - Insertion sort    
      

      + Correct!
