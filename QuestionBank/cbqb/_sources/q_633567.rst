    You must store a large amount of data, and both searching and inserting new    
    elements must be as fast as possible. What's the simplest data structure that    
    meets your needs?    
    

    - Ordered array    
      

      - Hashtables provide O(1) insertion and searching, provided collisions aren't    
        too numerous.
    - Linked list    
      

      - Hashtables provide O(1) insertion and searching, provided collisions aren't    
        too numerous.
    - Hashtable    
      

      + Correct!
    - Binary search tree    
      

      - Hashtables provide O(1) insertion and searching, provided collisions aren't    
        too numerous.
    - Self-balancing tree    
      

      - Hashtables provide O(1) insertion and searching, provided collisions aren't    
        too numerous.
