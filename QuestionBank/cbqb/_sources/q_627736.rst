    3. Consider the following class definition.    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           import java.util.Scanner;

              private int num, totalRed, totalBlack;    
        
              public SillyClass2 () {    
                 num = 0;    
                 totalRed = 0;    
                 totalBlack = 0;    
                 this.spinWheel();    
                 System.out.print("Black: " + totalBlack);    
                 System.out.println(" and red: " + totalRed);    
              }    
        
              public void spinWheel () {    
                 Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in);    
                 System.out.println("Enter 1 or 0, -1 to quit.");    
                 num = kbd.nextInt();    
                 while (num >= 0) {    
                    if (num == 0)    
                       totalRed++;    
                    else if (num == 1)    
                       totalBlack++;    
                    else System.out.println("Try again");    
                    System.out.println("Enter 1 or 0, -1 to quit).");

                 }    
                 System.out.println("Thanks for playing.");    
              }    
           }    
        
    Which of the following sequences of inputs causes every line of code to be    
    executed at least once?    
    

    - 0    0    10    -1    
      

      - This question tests understanding of a conditional nested inside a loop.    
        Choice A is wrong, because the initial value must be >= 0 for the loop to be    
        executed. Choice E is wrong, because the last value must be -1, or the code    
        never exits the loop and the last line of code is not executed. Choices B and    
        C are wrong, because inside the loop, we need one value that's 0, one value    
        that's 1, and one value that's greater than 1, so that each branch of the    
        conditional will be executed.
    - 1    0    1    -1
