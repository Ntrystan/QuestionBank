    Programs implementing the "Examine All" programming pattern typically run in    
    time:    
    

    - *O* (n2)    
      

      - Examine all algorithm need, in the worst case, to individually "process" each    
        element or value in the input once.  Hence examine all algorithms exhibit a    
        linear run time.  Examples of examine all algorithms include _Find Largest,    
        Count Odd,_ or _, Is Sorted._
    - *O* (n3)    
      

      - Examine all algorithm need, in the worst case, to individually "process" each    
        element or value in the input once.  Hence examine all algorithms exhibit a    
        linear run time.  Examples of examine all algorithms include _Find Largest,    
        Count Odd,_ or _, Is Sorted._
    - *O* (n)    
      

      + Correct!
    - *O* (n!)    
      

      - Examine all algorithm need, in the worst case, to individually "process" each    
        element or value in the input once.  Hence examine all algorithms exhibit a    
        linear run time.  Examples of examine all algorithms include _Find Largest,    
        Count Odd,_ or _, Is Sorted._
    - *O* (n log2 n)    
      

      - Examine all algorithm need, in the worst case, to individually "process" each    
        element or value in the input once.  Hence examine all algorithms exhibit a    
        linear run time.  Examples of examine all algorithms include _Find Largest,
