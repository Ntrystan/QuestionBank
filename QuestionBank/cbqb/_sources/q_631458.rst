    Given the code    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int x = 27;    
           int y = 12;    
        
    What is the value of the expression ``x%y``\ ?    
    

    - 2    
      

      - In Java, the % operator means "remainder." So this question is asking, "What    
        is the remainder when you divide 27 by 12?"   27 - (2*12) = 3, so the answer    
        is 3.
    - 2.25
