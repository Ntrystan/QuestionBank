       1. import java.util.ArrayList;    
       2. public BallPanel extends javax.swing.JPanel {    
       3.    private Ball[] _balls;    
       4.    private ArrayList <Ball> _moreBalls;    
       5.    public BallPanel(){    
       6.       _balls = new Ball[20];    
       7.       _moreBalls = new ArrayList<Ball>();    
       8.       for (int i=0;i<10;i++) {    
       9.          _balls[i] = new Ball();    
       10.         _moreBalls.add(_balls[i]);    
       11.      }    
       12.   }    
       13. ...    
        
        
    ```    
        
    After line 11, what are the values of\ ``_balls.length`` and ``_moreBalls.size()``    
    respectively?    
    

    - 0, 0    
      

      - _balls.length is set to 20 when the array is instantiated (in line 6) and is    
        independent of the array contents.    
            
        `_moreBalls.size() indicates the number of values stored in the ArrayList,    
        which is 10 from the 10 adds in the loop.`
    - 10, 10

      + Correct!
