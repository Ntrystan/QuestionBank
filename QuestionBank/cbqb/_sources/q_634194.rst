    Nathan is on the run (apparently the US is about to invade Canada). He needs    
    to grab food.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    Each piece of food around him has a nutritional value, and a weight. He wants    
    to put the\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    most calories in his backpack, but it can only hold up to certain weight. What    
    should he\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    optimize for when deciding which foods to bring?    
    

    - The value of food    
      

      - Greedy approach to fractional knapsack.
    - The value / weight ratio of food
