    You have a class Custom:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           class Custom {    
             private int i;    
             ...    
             public String toString() {    
               return "" + i;    
             }    
           }    
        
    Consider this code, which prints a Custom instance:    
        
    ``Custom a = ...;``    
        
    ``System.out.println(a);``      
        
    What overloaded version of PrintStream.println is called?    
    

    - println(String s)    
      

      - The version of println that we call must have a type that is a supertype of    
        Custom, leaving only Custom and Object as our two choices. Since PrintStream    
        was written years before our Custom class ever existed, it doesn't know    
        anything about our class. However, it does know about Objects and that all    
        Objects have a toString method.
    - println(Custom c)

      + Correct!
