    Chris implements a standard sorting algorithm that sorts the numbers 64, 25,    
    12, 22, 11 like so:    
        
    64 25 12 22 11    
        
    11 25 12 22 64    
        
    11 12 25 22 64    
        
    11 12 22 25 64    
        
    11 12 22 25 64    
        
    Which sorting algorithm is this?    
    

    - Inserton sort    
      

      - In the first line, we see the min is pulled from the end of the array so we    
        know it's selection sort.
    - Selection sort    
      

      + Correct!
    - Bubble sort    
      

      - In the first line, we see the min is pulled from the end of the array so we    
        know it's selection sort.
    - Merge sort    
      

      - In the first line, we see the min is pulled from the end of the array so we    
        know it's selection sort.
