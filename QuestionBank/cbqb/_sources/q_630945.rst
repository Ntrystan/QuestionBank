    Which of the following abstract datatypes would be the best choice for part of    
    the implementation of the back button on a Web browser?    
    

    - a Stack    
      

      + Correct!
    - a Queue    
      

      - When you click on the back button, you should see the last page you visited,    
        so the datatype that stores the previously visited webpages must be last-in-    
        first-out. Of the abstract datatypes listed, Stack is the only one that is    
        last-in-first-out.
    - a Priority Queue    
      

      - When you click on the back button, you should see the last page you visited,    
        so the datatype that stores the previously visited webpages must be last-in-    
        first-out. Of the abstract datatypes listed, Stack is the only one that is    
        last-in-first-out.
    - a List    
      

      - When you click on the back button, you should see the last page you visited,    
        so the datatype that stores the previously visited webpages must be last-in-    
        first-out. Of the abstract datatypes listed, Stack is the only one that is    
        last-in-first-out.
