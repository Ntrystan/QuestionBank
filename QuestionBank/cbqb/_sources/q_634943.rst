    Consider the code    
        
    ``struct capacitor{``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
               double capacitance;    
           };    
        
    If given the variable struct capacitor *cap, which of the following will NOT    
    print the address of cap's capacitance?    
    

    - printf("%p\n", cap )    
      

      - C and D are equivalent; A is equivalent to them as capacitance is the first    
        thing stored in the struct.
    - printf("%p\n", &(cap.capacitance) )    
      

      + Correct!
    - printf("%p\n", &((*cap).capacitance) )    
      

      - C and D are equivalent; A is equivalent to them as capacitance is the first    
        thing stored in the struct.
    - printf("%p\n", &(cap->capacitance) )    
      

      - C and D are equivalent; A is equivalent to them as capacitance is the first    
        thing stored in the struct.
