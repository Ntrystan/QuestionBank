    Consider the code:\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    ``strcpy(str1, "abc");``    
        
    ``strcat(str1, "def");``    
        
    What is the value of str1?    
    

    - abc    
      

      - def is concatenated onto the end of abc
    - def    
      

      - def is concatenated onto the end of abc
    - abcdef    
      

      + Correct!
    - defabc
