    After the assignment statement\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    ``String word = "entropy";``\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    what is returned by\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    ``word.substring(word.length());``    
    

    - "entropy"    
      

      - `word.substring(n)` returns the substring of `word` that starts at index `n`    
        and ends at the end of the `String`. If index `n` is greater than the index of    
        the last character in the `String`, as it is here, `substring` simply returns    
        the empty `String`.
    - "y"    
      

      - `word.substring(n)` returns the substring of `word` that starts at index `n`    
        and ends at the end of the `String`. If index `n` is greater than the index of    
        the last character in the `String`, as it is here, `substring` simply returns    
        the empty `String`.
    - the empty ``String``    
      

      + Correct!
    - an error    
      

      - `word.substring(n)` returns the substring of `word` that starts at index `n`    
        and ends at the end of the `String`. If index `n` is greater than the index of    
        the last character in the `String`, as it is here, `substring` simply returns    
        the empty `String`.
    - none of the above    
      

      - `word.substring(n)` returns the substring of `word` that starts at index `n`
