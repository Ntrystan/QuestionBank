    In C, which of the following will return 1, if s1 = "hi" and s2 = "hi"? Circle    
    all that apply.    
    

    - s1 == s2    
      

      - C is not Python! Only strcmp will do what Python and similar languages would    
        do. (My CS2 students come into C having learnt Python.)
    - strcmp(s1, s2)    
      

      + Correct!
    - strlen(s1)

    - s1 == "hi"
