    Consider the following code snippet that copies elements (pixels) from one 2-d    
    array (called pict), with maximum dimensions of maxWidth and maxHeight into    
    another 2-d array called canvas.    
        
    canvas = [][]\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
    for row in range (0, maxHeight):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
        for col in range (0, maxWidth):\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
            origPixel = pict[col][row]\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
            canvas[width-1-col][row = origPixel    
        
    If one were to display canvas, how would it compare to the orignal picture (as    
    represented by pict)?    
    

    - Rotated 180 degrees around the vertical center line/column.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Rotated 180 degrees around the horizontal center line/row.    
      

      - Each pixel remains on the same row (line) that it originally was on.  For any    
        given row, the leftmost pixel swaps positions with the rightmost.  The second    
        pixel in a row swaps positions with the second last pixel in that row, etc.    
        Hence, the picture is rotated across the vertical center line.
    - Rotated left 90 degrees.
