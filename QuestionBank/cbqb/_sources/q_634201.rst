    Noor writes a program in C to evulate some Taylor series, to help her with her    
    calculus homework. She remembers to\ ``#include<math.h>`` before calling the\ ``pow`` function. But when she compiles with ``gcc taylor.c``\ , she gets an error    
    that ``pow`` is undefined. What she should instead type in the command-line to    
    compile successfully?    
    

    - gcc taylor.c -01    
      

      - -lm will manually link the math library.
    - gcc taylor.c -lm    
      

      + Correct!
    - gcc taylor.c -math    
      

      - -lm will manually link the math library.
    - gcc taylor.c -o taylor    
      

      - -lm will manually link the math library.
