    Consider the following class definition:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           import java.util.Scanner; // 1    
        
           public class SillyClass2 { // 2    
              private int num, totalRed, totalBlack; // 3    
              public SillyClass2 () { // 4    
                 num = 0; // 5    
                 totalRed = 0; // 6    
                 totalBlack = 0; // 7    
                 this.spinWheel(); // 8    
                 System.out.print("Black: " + totalBlack); // 9    
                 System.out.println(" and red: " + totalRed); // 10    
              } // 11    
        
    ``public void spinWheel () { // 12``    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
                 Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in); // 13    
                 System.out.println("Enter 1 or 0, -1 to quit."); // 14    
                 num = kbd.nextInt(); // 15    
                 while (num >= 0) { // 16    
                    if (num == 0) // 17    
                       totalRed++; // 18    
                    else if (num == 1) // 19    
                       totalBlack++; // 20    
                    else System.out.println("Try again"); // 21    
                    System.out.println("Enter 1 or 0, -1 to quit)."); // 22    
                    num = kbd.nextInt(); // 23    
                 } // 24    
                 System.out.println("Thanks for playing."); // 25    
              } // 26    
           } // 27    
        
    Which sequence of inputs will cause line 21 to be executed?    
    

    - -1    
      

      - Answers A, B, C, and E are incorrect because they contain no inputs greater    
        than 1. Answer D does contain an input greater than 1, and that input is after    
        a 0 (which causes the loop to be entered) and before the -1 (which causes the    
        loop to be exited).
    - 0   1   -1
