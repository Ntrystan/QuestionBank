    Consider the following Python code:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           in_str = input('Enter a string: ')    
           a = ''    
           d = 0    
           r = 1    
        
           for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':    
              if c in in_str:    
                 a = c + a    
              else:    
                 d = d + 1    
           r += 2    
        
           print(a) # Line 1    
           print(d) # Line 2    
           print(r) # Line 3    
    

    - 2    
      

      - The statement r+=2 is not inside the loop, so we just assign 1 to r, then add    
        2 to it to get 3.
    - 3    
      

      + Correct!
    - 21
