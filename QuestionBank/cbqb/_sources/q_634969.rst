    Consider the following interface definition:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public interface Mover {    
              public int getX();    
              public int getY();    
              public void setLocation(int x, int y);    
           }    
        
    Choose the best answer to describe the following implementation of that    
    interface:    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           public class CartoonCharacter implements Mover{    
              private int x, y;    
              public int getX() {return this.x;}    
              public int getY() {return this.y;}    
           }    
    

    - The class correctly implements the ``Mover`` interface because it says    
      ``implements Mover``.    
      

      - To implement a Java interface, a class must define all the methods required by    
        the interface (or declare itself abstract).    
            
        **Note:** There is no appropriate topic for this question. Suggestion:

    - The class does not correctly implement the ``Mover`` interface because it    
      includes method bodies for ``getX`` and ``getY``.

        the interface (or declare itself abstract).

    - The class does not correctly implement the ``Mover`` interface because it has    
      instance variables.

    - The class does not correctly implement the ``Mover`` interface because it fails    
      to define the ``setLocation`` method.    
      

      + Correct!
    - Both B and C.
