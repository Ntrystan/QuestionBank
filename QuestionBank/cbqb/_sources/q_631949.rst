    Given the input "Click & Clack", what is the output of line 17 of the    
    following Java code?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           System.out.println("Enter a string: ");    
           String input = kbd.nextLine();    
           String a = "";    
           String letter = "";    
           int d = 0;    
           int r = 1;    
           String englishAlphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";    
           for (int i = 0; i < englishAlphabet.length(); i++) {    
              letter = englishAlphabet.substring(i,i+1);    
              if (input.contains(letter)){    
                 a = letter + a;    
              } else {    
                 d++;    
              }    
           }    
           System.out.println("String a is: " + a); //line 16    
           System.out.println("int d is: " + d); // line 17    
    

    - 16    
      

      - d contains a count of the number of lower-case letters that do *not* appear in    
        the input string. Since there are 5 letters that do appear, the answer is 26-5    
        or 21.
