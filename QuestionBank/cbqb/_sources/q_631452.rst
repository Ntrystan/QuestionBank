    Given the code    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           int x = 27;    
           int y = 12;    
        
    What is the value of the expression  ``x/y``\ ?    
    

    - 2    
      

      + Correct!
    - 2.25    
      

      - In Java, when we divide one int value by another, we get another integer. You    
        can start by doing the usual division (which would give you 2.25 in this case)    
        and then remove the decimal part.
    - 3
