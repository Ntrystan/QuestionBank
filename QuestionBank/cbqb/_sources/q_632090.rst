    What is the value of j after this code is executed?    
        
    int i = 6, j = 10;    
        
    j += i;    
    

    - 4    
      

      - The value of variable i (6) is added to that of variable  j (10) resulting in    
        16 as the  new value of j
    - 6    
      

      - The value of variable i (6) is added to that of variable  j (10) resulting in    
        16 as the  new value of j
    - 10    
      

      - The value of variable i (6) is added to that of variable  j (10) resulting in    
        16 as the  new value of j
    - 16    
      

      + Correct!
    - Undefined    
      

      - The value of variable i (6) is added to that of variable  j (10) resulting in    
        16 as the  new value of j
