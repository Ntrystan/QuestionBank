    When is an adjacency matrix a good choice for implementing a graph?    
    

    - When the graph is undirected.    
      

      - The adjacency matrix will compactly and efficiently store edges when it    
        contains little wasted space. In a complete graph, each vertex shares an edge    
        with each other vertex, meaning all elements in the adjacency matrix will be    
        used.
    - When the graph is nearly complete.    
      

      + Correct!
    - When a graph has few edges.    
      

      - The adjacency matrix will compactly and efficiently store edges when it    
        contains little wasted space. In a complete graph, each vertex shares an edge    
        with each other vertex, meaning all elements in the adjacency matrix will be    
        used.
    - When the graph contains no cycles.

        used.
    - When the graph is connected.
