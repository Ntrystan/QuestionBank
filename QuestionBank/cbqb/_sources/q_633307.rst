    Searching a heap is    
    

    - O(1)    
      

      - In a heap, we only know that a node's key is greater than both its chidrens'    
        keys. We may need to search both subheaps for an element. In the worst case,    
        we'll visit every element.
    - O(log N)

      + Correct!
    - O(N log N)

    - O(N2)
