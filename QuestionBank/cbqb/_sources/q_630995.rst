    In the Java language, what is the value of this expression?    
        
    ``8 / 5 + 3.2``    
    

    - ``3``    
      

      - Because of precedence, the division operator is applied first.  Since it is    
        applied between two `int` values, the result is also an `int`, with any    
        fractional part truncated.  The result of the division is therefore 1. Next,    
        the addition is performed, giving the result: 4.2.
    - ``3.2``
