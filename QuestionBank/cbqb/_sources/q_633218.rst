    Suppose we're modeling a person with just name and age. The notation    
    {"Javier", 31} refers to a 31-year-old named Javier. Now, suppose we have this    
    collection of five people:    
        
    {"Lupe", 29}    
        
    {"Dean", 29}    
        
    {"Lars", 28}    
        
    {"Javier", 31}    
        
    {"Di", 28}    
        
    Which of the following ordered collections is the result of applying a    
    *stable* sort to this collection, where the sorting criteria orders by age?    
    

    - .. role:: raw-html-m2r(raw)    
         :format: html    
          
          
      {"Javier", 31}\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      {"Dean", 29}\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      {"Lupe", 29}\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      {"Di", 28}\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      {"Lars", 28}    
      

      - A stable sort preserves the relative order of elements with the same keys.    
        Thus, Lupe must appear before Dean and Lars must appear before Di. Only the    
        correct answer maintains this order.

      {"Lars", 28}\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`    
      {"Di", 28}    
      

      + Correct!
