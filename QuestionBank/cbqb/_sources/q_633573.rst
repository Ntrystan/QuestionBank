    Suppose you try to perform a binary search on a 5-element array sorted in the    
    reverse order of what the binary search algorithm expects. How many of the    
    items in this array will be found if they are searched for?    
    

    - 5    
      

      - Only the middle element will be found. The remaining elements will not be    
        contained in the subranges that we narrow our search to.
    - 0    
      

      - Only the middle element will be found. The remaining elements will not be    
        contained in the subranges that we narrow our search to.
    - 1
