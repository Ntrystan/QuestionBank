    Given this class diagram, what best describes what happens with the code    
    fragment above?    
    

    - The code compiles and executes fine    
      

      - The code will not compile due to the error in line 5: gary's parkCar method    
        takes a parameter of type SportsCar, but fineCar's declared type is Car.  Even    
        though fineCar's actual type is SportsCar, the compiler will not let a    
        variable declared as a superclass of the parameter's type be used in the    
        method.    
            
        Line 2 has no problems, as having the actual type be a subclass of the    
        declared type is legitimate.
    - Code fails at compile time, error in line 2    
      

      - The code will not compile due to the error in line 5: gary's parkCar method

      + Correct!
    - Code fails at execution time, error in line 5
