    The following methods are in Java's String class:    
        
        
    * int indexOf(int ch) - Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified character.    
    * int indexOf(int ch, int fromIndex) - Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified character, starting the search at the specified index.    
    * String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) - Returns a new string that is a substring of this string. The substring begins at the specified beginIndex and extends to the character at index endIndex - 1. Thus the length of the substring is endIndex-beginIndex.    
        
    Given these specifications, what does the following code print?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           String s = "ichi,ni,san,go";    
           int i1 = s.indexOf(',');    
           int i2 = s.indexOf(',', i1);    
           System.out.println(s.substring(i1, i2));    
    

    - ``"ni"``    
      

      + Correct!
    - The empty string    
      

      - i1 is 4, and so is i2, since the second indexOf call begins searching at the    
        position of the same comma that was found by the first indexOf call. Calling    
        substring with identical parameters yields a 0-length String.
    - ``","``    
      

      - i1 is 4, and so is i2, since the second indexOf call begins searching at the    
        position of the same comma that was found by the first indexOf call. Calling    
        substring with identical parameters yields a 0-length String.
    - ``",ni"``    
      

      - i1 is 4, and so is i2, since the second indexOf call begins searching at the    
        position of the same comma that was found by the first indexOf call. Calling    
        substring with identical parameters yields a 0-length String.
