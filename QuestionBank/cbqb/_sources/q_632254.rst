    Suppose you are trying to choose between an array and a linked list to store    
    the data in your Java program. Which data structure can change size as needed    
    while the program is running?    
    

    - an array    
      

      - When initializing a Java array, you must allocate a fixed amount of memory for    
        storing data. Linked lists vary in size depending on how much data they    
        contain.
    - a linked list    
      

      + Correct!
    - both    
      

      - When initializing a Java array, you must allocate a fixed amount of memory for    
        storing data. Linked lists vary in size depending on how much data they    
        contain.
    - neither
