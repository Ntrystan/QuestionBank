    Suppose you try to perform a binary search on the unsorted array {1, 4, 3, 7,    
    15, 9, 24}. How many of the items in this array will be found if they are    
    searched for?    
    

    - 3    
      

      - 7, 4, 9, 24, and 1 will be found if searched for. 15 and 3 will not, since    
        they lie to the wrong side of a subrange's midpoint.
    - 4    
      

      - 7, 4, 9, 24, and 1 will be found if searched for. 15 and 3 will not, since    
        they lie to the wrong side of a subrange's midpoint.
    - 5    
      

      + Correct!
    - 6    
      

      - 7, 4, 9, 24, and 1 will be found if searched for. 15 and 3 will not, since    
        they lie to the wrong side of a subrange's midpoint.
    - 0    
      

      - 7, 4, 9, 24, and 1 will be found if searched for. 15 and 3 will not, since    
        they lie to the wrong side of a subrange's midpoint.
