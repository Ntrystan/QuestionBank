    Which of the following makes an appropriate pre-condition for this code?    
        
    .. code-block::    
        
        
           double calculate_percentage(double sum, double n)    
           {    
              // calculates and returns a percentage given a sum and a length (n)    
              // <missing pre-condition>    
              // POST: none    
              return (sum / n) * 100;    
           }    
    

    - PRE: sum < 100    
      

      - Want to avoid the divide by 0
    - PRE: n != 0    
      

      + Correct!
    - PRE: sum != NULL and n != NULL    
      

      - Want to avoid the divide by 0
    - PRE: none    
      

      - Want to avoid the divide by 0
