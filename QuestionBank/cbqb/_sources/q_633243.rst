    Locating a new node's insertion point in a binary search tree stops when    
    

    - We reach a null child.    
      

      + Correct!
    - We find a node greater than the node to be inserted.    
      

      - Finding nodes less than or greater than the new node happens frequently as we    
        traverse the tree. Tree's don't have maximum levels. The insertion point isn't    
        necessarily a leaf node. The remaining option of stopping when we reach null    
        is the correct answer because we have found the new node's parent node.
    - We reach the tree's maximum level.
