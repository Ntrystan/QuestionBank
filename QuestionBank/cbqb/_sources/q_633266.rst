    Two algorithms accomplish the same task on a collection of N items. Algorithm    
    A performs N/2 operations. Algorithm B performs N log N operations. Under what    
    conditions does algorithm A offer better performance?    
    

    - N <= 4    
      

      - For all legal collection sizes, N/2 < N log N.
    - N > 8    
      

      - For all legal collection sizes, N/2 < N log N.
    - N > 2    
      

      - For all legal collection sizes, N/2 < N log N.
    - For all N.    
      

      + Correct!
    - For no N.    
      

      - For all legal collection sizes, N/2 < N log N.
