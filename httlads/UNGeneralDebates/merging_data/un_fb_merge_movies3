   What is the  average revenue of a comedy movie?

   - :(12649482.34|12649482): Is Correct
     :(12608821.677012537|12608821.678|12608821|12608821.68): Is a good try, but does not account for duplicate data.
     :166966016647.0: Is the total revenue
     :x: Hint: Use the fact that imdb_id is the only column in both DataFrames
