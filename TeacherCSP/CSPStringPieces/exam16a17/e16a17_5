   :answer_a: 10 and -1
   :answer_b: 5 and 2
   :answer_c: 10 and 4
   :answer_d: 5 and 1
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if we were using index 2 everywhere instead of index 1.
   :feedback_b: Since arrays indicies start at 0 this will print the 2nd element of a which is 5 and then add one to the second element of b which is 1 and print it.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if we were using index 0 everywhere instead of index 1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we hand't added 1 to b[1] before printing it.

   What is the output from the code below?

   ::

      a = [10,5,10,6]
      print (a[1])
      b = [3,1,-2]
      b[1] = b[1] + 1
      print (b[1])
