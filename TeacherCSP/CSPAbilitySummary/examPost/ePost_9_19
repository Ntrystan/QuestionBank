   :answer_a: 6          [3, 1, -2]         -2
   :answer_b: 6          [3, 1, -2]         -1
   :answer_c: 6          [3, 1, -2]          2
   :answer_d: 10        [3, 1, -2]          1
   :answer_e: 10        [3, 1, -2]          2
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if we hand't changed the value at index 2 in b.
   :feedback_b: This will print the value at index 3 in a which is 6.  Then it will print b which has [3, 1, -2].  Then it adds one to the value at index 2 in b which is -2 so -2 + 1 is -1.  Then is prints the value at index 2 in b which is -1.
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if the original value at index 2 in b was 1, but it was -2.
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if we had added 3 to the value at index 2 in b.
   :feedback_e: This would be correct if we had added 4 to the value at index 2 in b.

   What is the output from the program below?

   ::

      a = [10,5,10,6]
      print (a[3])
      b = [3,1,-2]
      print b
      b[2] = b[2] + 1
      print (b[2])
