   :answer_c: is the end
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This will print the character at position 5 in the string which is i.  Remember that the first character is at position 0.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the first character was at position 1 instead of 0.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it returned from the given position to the end of the string, but that isn't what it does.

   What will be printed when the following executes?

   ::

     str = "This is the end"
     str = str[5]
     print(str)
