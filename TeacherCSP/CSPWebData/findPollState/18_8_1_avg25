   The following program prints the average PM 2.5 pollution for a state, but the code is mixed up. Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.  Then click on <i>Check Me</i> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order or have the wrong indention.
