  :answer_a: 74
  :answer_b: 64
  :answer_c: 75
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: This is the actual value to be printed. If Sam predicted 74, then he has a correct understanding of the while loop.
  :feedback_b: If Sam held this misconception, he would predict that the while loop would run twice: the second time when targetTemperature is set to 64.
  :feedback_c: If Sam chose this option, he might have a correct understanding of the while loop, but his arithmetic will be slightly off: since the program reduces roomTemperature by 2 each time, and since roomTemperature starts at 90, an even number, we expect the final roomTemperature value to be an even number as well, not 75.

   If Sam had the “waiting” ``while`` misconception, what would he predict the output would be?
