   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if counter started off with a value of 0.
   :feedback_b: This loop executes 3 times.  After the first loop sum = 1 and counter = 3, after the second loop sum = 4 and counter = 5, and after the third loop sum = 9 and counter = 7.
   :feedback_c: This is the value of counter, but this code prints the value of sum.
   :feedback_d: This would be the value of counter after the loop if counter started at 0.

   What will the following code print?

   ::

      counter = 1
      sum = 0
      while counter <= 6:
          sum = sum + counter
          counter = counter + 2
      print (sum)
