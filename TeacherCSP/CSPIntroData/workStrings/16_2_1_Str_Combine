   :correct: b,c,d
   :answer_a: print(start+name)
   :answer_b: print(start+name+name+name)
   :answer_c: print(start + (3 * name))
   :answer_d: print(start + 3 * name)
   :feedback_a: This just generates: My name is Mark
   :feedback_b: Could you also use multiplication?
   :feedback_c: This will work, but multiplication is processed before addition, so you do not have to have parentheses.
   :feedback_d: This will work just fine.

   If we wanted to add one line to the above to print "My name is MarkMarkMark", which one of these would do it? Choose all that are correct.
