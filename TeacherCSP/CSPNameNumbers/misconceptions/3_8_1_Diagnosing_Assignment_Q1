  :answer_a: Sam may see assignment as a move.
  :answer_b: Sam may see assignment as a copy.
  :answer_c: Sam may see assignment as a relationship.
  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: Assignment-as-move says that number1 is 32 and number2 has 17, but number2 was empty or zero after number1 = number2
  :feedback_b: Assignment really is a copy, so that's not a misconception.  Assignment-as-copy wouldn't lead to number1 being 17.
  :feedback_c: If Sam thinks changing number2 changes number1, Sam may misunderstand assignment as creating a relationship.

   If the answer was `17`, Sam might have what kind of misconception?
