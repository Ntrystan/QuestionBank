   :answer_c: 200
   :answer_d: 90
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: How much will it go forward?
   :feedback_b: What value is size set to?
   :feedback_c: Size is set to 200 in line 2 so this will draw a square that has a side length of 200.
   :feedback_d: It turns 90 degrees.  It doesn't go forward 90.

   What is the side length for a square drawn by the following procedure?

    ::

     def square(turtle):
         size = 200
         turtle.forward(size)
         turtle.right(90)
         turtle.forward(size)
         turtle.right(90)
         turtle.forward(size)
         turtle.right(90)
         turtle.forward(size)
         turtle.right(90)
