   :feedback_a: When you print a variable it will print the value of the variable.
   :feedback_b: When you call myFunction("Second") the value of parameter is set to "Second".  This code prints the value of the variable called "value" which is set to the value of parameter.
   :feedback_c: When value = parameter is executed the value of parameter is copied into the space called value.
   :feedback_d: While value was first set to "First" it was changed to a copy of the value of parameter.

   What value is printed when the following code is executed?

   ::

      name = "John Smith"
      def myFunction(parameter):
          value = "First"
          value = parameter
          print (value)

      myFunction("Second")
