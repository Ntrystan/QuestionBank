   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Notice that n is changed to n/2 after the inner loop.
   :feedback_b: Correct. By following the code, you can see that the triangle ends up in (1,3).
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. The triangle only turns right throughout the enter code segment.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Did you miss the TURN_RIGHT call after the inner loop?

   ::

     n ← 4

               {
                  MOVE_FORWARD
               }
               TURN_RIGHT
               n ← n/2
     }
