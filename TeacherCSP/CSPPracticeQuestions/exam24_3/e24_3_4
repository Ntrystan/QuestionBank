   :answer_a: How does wind speed fluctuate from day to night?
   :answer_b: During which hour of the day does it rain the most on average?
   :answer_c: Is there a correlation between air pressure and precipitation?
   :answer_d: Is there a correlation between Atlanta’s daily average temperature and Chicago’s daily average temperature?
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. The meteorologists do not have wind speed data.
   :feedback_b: Correct. The meteorologists have precipitation data for a year, so they can calculate this.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. The meteorologists do not have air pressure data.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. The meteorologists do not have data for Chicago's temperature.

   Meteorologists record atmospheric data to predict future weather conditions. Suppose that a meteorological lab in Atlanta takes hourly measurements of air temperature and precipitation in the city for a total period of 12 months. Note that the lab also records the exact time and date for each measurement.

   Which of the following questions about Atlanta’s weather can be accurately answered using only the data collected by the lab?
