   :answer_a: The run-time is directly proportional to the input size.
   :answer_b: The run-time is inversely proportional to the input size.
   :answer_c: The run-time of the program does not change with respect to the input size.
   :answer_d: The run-time first increases and then decreases as the input size is increased.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct. This is true because every additional input requires the same amount of additional time.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. This is incorrect because the number of steps doesn't decrease with more inputs for this algorithm.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. The number of steps an algorithm goes through does influence the the time an algorithm takes to run for this algorithm.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. As the number of inputs increases, the number of steps in this algorithm will always be increasing in this case.

   If the number of steps that an algorithm takes is equal to a linear function of the input size, then which of the following statements is true regarding the runtime of the algorithm?
