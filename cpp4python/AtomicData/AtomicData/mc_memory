  :answer_a: using ``&``
  :answer_b: using ``*``
  :answer_c: using ``id``
  :answer_d: It depends upon the implementation.
  :answer_e: none of the above
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Right! ``&`` is the "address-of" operator, used to reference an address.
  :feedback_b: No. ``int *p;`` defines a pointer to an integer, and ``*p`` would dereference that pointer, i.e. retrieve the data that p points to.
  :feedback_c: No. This is used in Python.
  :feedback_d: No. Try again.
  :feedback_e: One of the above is indeed correct.

  How may one reference a variable's memory address in C++?
