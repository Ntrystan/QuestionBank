    :multiple_answers:
    :answer_a: To keep a program from writing into other files.
    :answer_b: To keep a program from stopping.
    :answer_c: To make sure you do not overflow into temporary buffer.
    :answer_d: To stop an input files stream.
    :correct: a,c,d
    :feedback_a: Yes, EOFs are intended to prevent the program from overwriting a file.
    :feedback_b: Not quite, the point of EOFs is to do the opposite.
    :feedback_c: Yes, EOFs prevent overflow into temporary buffer.
    :feedback_d: Yes, EOFs stop input file streams.

    What are good use cases for EOFs in C++ programming?
