The Runestone Question Bank
===========================

This repository contains all of the questions in their original RST form from books
published on Runestone Academy.

The QuestionBank folder is organized by ``basecourse / chapter / subchapter`` roughly speaking
this is a reasonable approximation of a subject area and one level of specialization within
the subject area.  This could surely be improved and it would be useful to provide mappings
between the different books that use different chapter and subchapter names that mean the same
thing.
