    What will the following print?

    .. code-block:: javascript

        var v = 1;
        function fun1() {
            console.log(v);
        }

        function fun2() {
            var v = 2;
            fun1();
        };

        fun2();

    - 1

      + Correct

    - 2

      - No, the value of v is obtained from the Closure

    - 3

      - Now I think you're just messin with me.

    - It will print an error

      - The code will run without error
