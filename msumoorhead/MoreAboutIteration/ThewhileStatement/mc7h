   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Setting a variable so the loop condition would be false in the middle of the loop body does not keep the variable from actually being set.
   :feedback_b: Setting a variable so the loop condition would be false in the middle of the loop body does not stop execution of statements in the rest of the loop body.
   :feedback_c: After n becomes 5 and the test would be False, but the test does not actually come until after the end of the loop - only then stopping execution of the repetition of the loop.


   What is printed by this code?

   .. code-block:: python

     n = 1
     x = 2
     while n < 5:
         n = n + 1
         x = x + 1
         n = n + 2
         x = x + n
     print(n, x)
