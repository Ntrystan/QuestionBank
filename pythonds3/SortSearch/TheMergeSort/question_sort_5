   :answer_a: [16, 49, 39, 27, 43, 34, 46, 40]
   :answer_b: [21,1]
   :answer_c: [21, 1, 26, 45]
   :answer_d: [21]
   :feedback_a: This is the second half of the list.
   :feedback_b: Yes, mergesort will continue to recursively move toward the beginning of the list until it hits a base case.
   :feedback_c: Remember mergesort doesn't work on the right half of the list until the left half is completely sorted.
   :feedback_d: This is the list after 4 recursive calls

   Given the following list of numbers: <br> [21, 1, 26, 45, 29, 28, 2, 9, 16, 49, 39, 27, 43, 34, 46, 40] <br> which answer illustrates the list to be sorted after 3 recursive calls to mergesort?
