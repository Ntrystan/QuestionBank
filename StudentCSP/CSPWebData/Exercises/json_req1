   Put the following code in order to create a function get_data.  The function will try to read JSON from a URL (generated from the parameters and base url) using requests.get and load the JSON into a dictionary. If there is an error it will print an error message and set the dictionary to the empty dictionary.   If the length of the dictionary is greater than 0 it will get another dictionary using the "results" and then print the values at the "sunrise" and "sunset" keys in that dictionary.
