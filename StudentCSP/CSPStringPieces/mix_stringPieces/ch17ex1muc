   The following program segment should split the string "phrase" by each word and assign the result to variable "x". Then insert the word "Jordan" into the string <i>final</i> and print the result.  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include extra blocks that aren't needed in the solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
   -----
   phrase = "Who did Jordan play against?"
   =====
   x = phrase.split(" ")
   =====
   x = split(phrase) #distractor
   =====
   name = x[2]
   =====
   name = x[3] #distractor
   =====
   final = name + "is his name."
   =====
   print(final)
