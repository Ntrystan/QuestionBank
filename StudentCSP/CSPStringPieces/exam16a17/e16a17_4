   :answer_c: The empty string
   :answer_d: It will cause an error
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The for each loop will loop through each character and add it to the front of the result so this will reverse the string.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was resString = resString + char
   :feedback_c: While resString was initialized to the empty string it changes in the for each loop.
   :feedback_d: This is the correct syntax for the for each loop.

   What does the following code print?

   ::

      myString = "It is a nice day"
      resString = ""
      for char in myString:
         resString = char + resString
      print resString
