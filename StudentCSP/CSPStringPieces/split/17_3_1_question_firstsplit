   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: That's pieces[1].
   :feedback_b: That's pieces[2]
   :feedback_c: The address is at position 3 in the resulting list.
   :feedback_d: That's pieces[4]
   :feedback_e: Why would this cause an error?  We can use indices to get the element at an index in a list.

   What do you think we would get if we executed ``print(pieces[3])``
