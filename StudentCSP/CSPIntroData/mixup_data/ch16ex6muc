   The following program segment should reverse the order of the list <i>oldList</i>, by storing it in the list <i>soFar</i>. Print the result at the end. The blocks have been mixed up and include extra blocks that aren't needed in the solution. Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.
