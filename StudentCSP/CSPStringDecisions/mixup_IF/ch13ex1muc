   The following pseudocode program segment should print the number of temperatures that are above freezing (greater than 32 degrees). But, the blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that isn't needed in the solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
