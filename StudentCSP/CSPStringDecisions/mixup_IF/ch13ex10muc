   The following program segment should ask the user to first input two numbers which will serve as parameters, then ask for a third number and determine whether it falls within the range of the first two numbers. The blocks have been mixed up and include extra blocks that aren't needed in the solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
