   The following pseudocode program segment should increase the value of every item in the list by 1 if the original value is less than 3.  The shorts are originally $39.99 each. But, the blocks have been mixed up and include an extra block that isn't needed in the solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
