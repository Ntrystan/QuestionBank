   Put the blocks in order to define a function draw_rect that draws a rectangle using 
   the passed turtle and the given width and height.  Before you move the turtle 
   make sure that it is heading east (0).

   def draw_rect(turtle,width,height):

       for i in range(4): #paired

           turtle.forward(width)
           turtle.right(90)
