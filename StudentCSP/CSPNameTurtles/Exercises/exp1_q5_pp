   Put the blocks in order to define the function get_names that takes a list of dictionaries and returns a list of strings with the names from the dictionaries. The key for the first name is ‘first’ and the key for the last name is ‘last’. Return a list of the full names (first last) as a string. If the ‘first’ or ‘last’ key is missing in the dictionary use ‘Unknown’.
