   Put the mixed up code below in order to define a function get_results that gets the number of students who passed the AP exam with a 3 (row 72), 4 (row 71), or 5 (row 70) and the percent that passed for a column from an excel spreadsheet.  Return a tuple with the total who passed and the percentage that passed.

   =====
   define get_results(infile, col): #distractor
   =====
       wb = load_workbook(infile)
       ci = column_index_from_string(col)

       num_fives = ws.cell(row = 70, column = ci).value
       num_fours = ws.cell(row = 71, column = ci).value

   =====
       total_pass = num_fives + num_fours + num_threes
       total = ws.cell(row = 75, column = ci).value
