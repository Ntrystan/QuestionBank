   Put the blocks in order to define a has22 function that returns True if there are at least two adjacent items that are both equal to 2, otherwise it returns False.  For example, it should return True for [1, 2, 2] since two items that are both equal to 2 are adjacent (at index 1 and 2) and should return false for [2, 1, 2] since the 2's are not adjacent.
