  :answer_a: totalCost = numApples + numPears
  :answer_b: totalCost = (costPerApple * numApples) + (costPerPear * numPears)
  :answer_c: totalCost = (costPerApple * numPears) + (costPerPear * numApples)
  :answer_d: totalCost = (0.4 * numApples) + (0.65 + numPears)
  :correct: b
  :feedback_a: That does not consider the cost of the apples or pears.
  :feedback_b: We need to multiply the cost per apple times the number of apples and add it to the cost per pear times the number of pears.
  :feedback_c: That gets the costs backwards
  :feedback_d: That would work, but giving names to numbers makes code easier to understand.

   Which line of code will compute the correct ``totalCost`` if put into the program above?
