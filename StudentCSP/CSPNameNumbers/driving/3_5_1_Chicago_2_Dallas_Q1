   :answer_b: No
   :answer_c: We should fly instead.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, the cost would be $89.86 (which you knew by editing the program above and running it)
   :feedback_b: Try it -- it's just under $90.
   :feedback_c: You might be right, but figure out the cost by editing the above program

   If the cost per gallon drops to $3.45, can we drive from Chicago to Dallas for less than $90 in gas?
