.. parsonsprob:: loop_avg_drop_lowest
   :numbered: left

   Order the code to return the average of a list of numbers, but drop the lowest value.  However, if the list 
   only has one value then return that.  For example, get_avg_drop_lowest([90]) returns 90 and 
   get_avg_drop_lowest([90, 10]) also returns 90.
