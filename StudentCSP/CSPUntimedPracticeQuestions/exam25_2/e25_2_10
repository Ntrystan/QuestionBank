  :answer_a: “I am a freshman.”
  :answer_b: Nothing is displayed.
  :answer_c: "I am not a freshman"
  :answer_d: DISPLAY("I am not a freshman")
  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: Incorrect. This would print if freshman were True.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Nothing would display if there were no ELSE clause.
  :feedback_c: Correct. Since freshman is False and there is an ELSE clause, the block after the ELSE is run.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Only the text inside the quotations in the DISPLAY function is displayed.

  Consider the code below.

  IF(freshman)

   { DISPLAY(“I am a freshman.”) }

  ELSE

   { DISPLAY(“I am not a freshman.”)}

  If the variable freshman is false, what is displayed?
