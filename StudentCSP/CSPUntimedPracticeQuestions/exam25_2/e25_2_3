   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. After the .split() function, the while loop will break.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. The remainder of 6 divided by 2 is equal to 0 and the loop will break.
   :feedback_c: Correct. The variable counter begins at a value greater than 0 and continues to increase which leads to an infinite loop.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. The program will eventually end since x is subtracted by 1 each time through the loop.

   Which of the following will result in an infinite loop?

   (A)
   :::

   x ← “heLLo”

   while x[2] == ’L’:

    DISPLAY(x)

    x ← x.split(‘h’)

   (B)
   ::

   my_num ← 6

   while my_num ≠ 0:

    DISPLAY(“Hello World”)

    my_num ← my_num % 2

   (C)
   ::

   counter ← 10

   while counter > 0:

    DISPLAY(counter)

    counter ← counter + 1


   (D)
   ::

   x ← 5

   while x > 0:

    DISPLAY(x)

    x ← x - 1

   DISPLAY(“x is now” + x)
