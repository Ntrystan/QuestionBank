   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: There is just the one in the accumulator to start.
   :feedback_b: If we just mirrored the string, there would be only two.  But we are mirroring with something in the accumulator.
   :feedback_c: That is true at the end, but not when letter contains the first letter of <code>"Wizard"</code>
   :feedback_d: At most, there will be three in <code>newString</code>.

   When the variable ``letter`` contains the ``"W"`` from ``Wizard``, how many exclamation points are in ``newString``?
