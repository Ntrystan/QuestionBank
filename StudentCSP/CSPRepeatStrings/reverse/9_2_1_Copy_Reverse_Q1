   :answer_a: Because we add each new letter at the <i>end</i> of <code>newStringB</code>.
   :answer_b: Because <code>newStringA</code> is adding the characters from left to right.
   :answer_c: Because we called a reverse function.
   :answer_d: Because the <code>for</code> loop is doing a reversal
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Each new letter gets added at the end, which creates a reversal.
   :feedback_b: How would that reverse the other string?
   :feedback_c: There is no reverse function in this program.
   :feedback_d: The same <code>for</code> loop is creating both an in-order copy of the string and a reversed order of the string.  The <code>for</code> loop is the same in both cases.

   Why do you think ``newStringB`` has all the letters, but in the reverse order?
