   :answer_a: A square
   :answer_b: A rectangle that is taller than it is wide
   :answer_c: A diamond
   :answer_d: A rectangle that is wider than it is tall
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if all the forward amounts were the same.
   :feedback_b: Zari's heading is set to 90 which turns her to point due north.  So, the rectangle is taller than it is high.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if all the forward amounts were the same and the heading was 45 to start.
   :feedback_d: Turtles start off facing east and setting the heading to 90 turns it to face north.

   What shape would the following code draw?

   ::

     from turtle import *        # use the turtle library
     space = Screen()            # create a turtle screen (space)
     zari = Turtle()             # create a turtle named zari
     zari.setheading(90)
     zari.forward(100)           # tell zari to move forward by 100 units
     zari.right(90)              # turn by 90 degrees
     zari.forward(50)           # tell zari to move forward by 50 units
     zari.right(90)              # turn by 90 degrees
     zari.forward(100)           # tell zari to move forward by 100 units
     zari.right(90)              # turn by 90 degrees
     zari.forward(50)           # tell zari to move forward by 50 units
     zari.right(90)              # turn by 90 degrees
