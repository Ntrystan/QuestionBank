   :answer_a: How does the temperature fluctuate from day to night?
   :answer_b: Is there a correlation between air temperature and precipitation?
   :answer_c: What is the average annual precipitation?
   :answer_d: What is the average daily temperature?
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. The meteorologists have temperature data from days and nights so they can compare the differences between them.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. The meteorologists have temperature and precipitation data, so they can compare them and determine if there is a correlation.
   :feedback_c: Correct. The meteorologists only have data from one year, so they cannot calculate the average annual precipitation.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. The meteorologists have temperature data for an entire year, so they can find the average of daily temperatures across that time range.

   Meteorologists record atmospheric data to predict future weather conditions. Suppose that a meteorological lab in Atlanta takes hourly measurements of air temperature and precipitation in the city for a total period of 12 months. Note that the lab also records the exact time and date for each measurement.

   Which of the following questions about the cityâ€™s weather could NOT be accurately answered using only the data collected by the lab?
