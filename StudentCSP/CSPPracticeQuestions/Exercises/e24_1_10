   :answer_a: Because hexadecimal is a lower level of abstraction than binary.
   :answer_b: Because hexadecimal can be represented with fewer total digits than binary.
   :answer_c: Because numbers greater than 1 must be used for certain forms of digital data.
   :answer_d: Because hexadecimal is easier to convert to decimal form.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Incorrect. Hexademical is a higher level of abstraction since more information can be encoded in fewer hexadecimal digits.
   :feedback_b: Correct. Since hexadecimal is base 16 and binary is base 2, we need fewer hexadecimal digits than binary digits to encode the same information.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Both binary and hexademical can be used to represent decimals greater than 1.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. Calculations involved in converting hexadecimal to decimal are more intensive.

   Why is digital data often represented in hexadecimal as opposed to binary?
