    The following program segment should count and print the number of values in an array. But the blocks have been mixed up. Rearrange the blocks in the correct order on the right.

    -----
    int[] l = {25, 70, 70, 70, 76, 0, 34, 76};
    =====
    int a=0;
    =====
    for(int e:l){
    =====
       a++;
    =====
    }
    =====
    System.out.println(a);
