   Put the code in order to define total_values that takes a dictionary (dict) and returns the total of the values in the dictionary.  For example, total_values({'red': 3, 'blue': 2, 'green': 20}) would return 25.

   def total_values(dict):
   =====
   def total_values(): #distractor
   =====
       total = 0
   =====
       for key in dict:
   =====
       for key in dict #distractor
   =====
           total += dict[key]
   =====
           total += key #distractor

       return total
