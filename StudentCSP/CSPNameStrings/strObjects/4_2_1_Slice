   :answer_a: This is the end
   :answer_b: This
   :answer_c: his
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if we were printing the value of str and we hand't changed it on line 2.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the first position was 1 and the substring included the character at the end position, but the first character in a string is at position 0 and the substring won't include the character at the last position.
   :feedback_c: This will return a string that starts at position 1 and ends at position 3.

   What will be printed when the following executes?

   ::

     str = "This is the end"
     str = str[1:4]
     print(str)
