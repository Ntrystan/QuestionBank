   Put the code below in order to define a Car class.  A car has a make and model.  Define a constructor (__init__), a method to return the attributes as a string (__str__), and a method speed that takes an integer, theSpeed, and returns "speed: " followed by the value of theSpeed.

   class Car:
   =====
       def __init__(self, make, model):
   =====
       def init(self, make, model): #paired
   =====
           self.make = make
           self.model = model
   =====
       def __str__(self):
   =====
           return("make: " + self.make + " model: " + self.model)
   =====
           return(make:  + self.make + " model: " + self.model) #paired
   =====
           
       def forward(self, theSpeed):
   =====
       def forward(theSpeed, self): #paired
   =====
           return("speed: " + str(theSpeed))
   =====
           return("speed: " + theSpeed) #paired
