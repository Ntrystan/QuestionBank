   Finish the function below to return 'too low' if the guess is less
   than the passed target, 'correct' if they are equal, and 'too high' if the guess
   is greater than the passed target.  For example, check_guess(5,7) returns 
   'too low', check_guess(7,7) returns 'correct', and check_guess(9,7) returns 
   'too high'. There are three extra blocks that are not needed in a correct solution.
