   :feedback_a: This would be true if the alice.pencolor("red") was after the first forward.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the alice.pencolor("red") was before the first forward.
   :feedback_c: Since the alice.pencolor("red") is after the second forward the first two lines will be black and the last two will be red.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the alice.pencolor("red") was after the third forward.

      alice.left(90)
      alice.forward(50)
      alice.left(90)
      alice.pencolor("red")
      alice.forward(50)
      alice.left(90)
      alice.forward(50)
