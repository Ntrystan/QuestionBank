   :answer_a: a = 4 and b = 3
   :answer_b: a = 7 and b = 0
   :answer_c: a = 2 and b = -2
   :answer_d: a = 5 and b = 2
   :answer_e: a = 9 and b = 2
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the for loop stopped when i was equal to 4.
   :feedback_b: Here are the values of a and b at the end of each loop: i=1, a=3, b=4; i=2, a=6, b=3; i=3, a=4, b=3; i=4; a=7; b=0;
   :feedback_c: Go back and check your values each time through the loop.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the loop stopped when i was equal to 6, but it stops when i is equal to 5.
   :feedback_e: Keep a table of the variables and their values each time through the loop.

   What are the values of a and b after the for loop finishes?

   .. code-block:: java

     int a = 5, b = 2, temp;

     for (int i=1; i<=4; i++)
     {
        temp = a;
        a = i + b;
        b = temp â€“ i;
     }
