   :feedback_a: This would be true if the recursion stopped when you first the first non "x", but is that what happens?
   :feedback_b: This returns the number of "x"'s it finds in the str.
   :feedback_c: Did you notice the recursive calls?
   :feedback_d: How does it miss one "x"?
   :feedback_e: Since the first character is "x" how can this be true?

   What will the method below return when called with mystery(“xxzxyxx”)?

   .. code-block:: java

     public static int mystery(String str)
     {
        if (str.length() == 0) return 0;
        else
        {
           if (str.substring(0,1).equals("x")) return 1 +
                            mystery(str.substring(1));
           else return mystery(str.substring(1));
        }
     }
