   :answer_a: World w = null;
   :answer_b: World w = new World;
   :answer_c: World w = new World();
   :answer_d: World w = World();
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This declares a variable w that refers to a World object, but it doesn't create a World object or initialize it.
   :feedback_b: You must include parentheses () to call a constructor.
   :feedback_c: Use the new keyword followed by the classname and parentheses to create a new object and call the constructor.
   :feedback_d: You must use the new keyword to create a new object.

   Which of these is valid syntax for creating and initializing a World object?
