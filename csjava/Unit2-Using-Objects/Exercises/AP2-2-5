   :answer_a: Movie one = new Movie("Harry Potter", "Bob");
   :answer_b: Movie two = new Movie("Sponge Bob");
   :answer_c: Movie three = new Movie(title, rating, director);
   :answer_d: Movie four = new Movie("My Cool Movie", "Steven Spielburg", "4.4");
   :answer_e: Movie five = new Movie(t);
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: There is no Movie constructor with 2 parameters.
   :feedback_b: This creates a Movie object with the title "Sponge Bob".
   :feedback_c: It is not clear whether the variables title, rating, and director are the correct types or in the correct order.
   :feedback_d: The third argument "4.4" is a String because it is in quotes, but the constructor expects a double.
   :feedback_e: It is not clear whether t is the correct type for this constructor.

    Consider the following class.  Which of the following code segments would successfully create a new Movie object?

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Movie
        {
            private String title;
            private String director;
            private double rating;
            private boolean inTheaters;

            public Movie(String t, String d, double r)
            {
                title = t;
                director = d;
                rating = r;
                inTheaters = false;
            }

            public Movie(String t)
            {
                title = t;
                director = "unknown";
                rating = 0.0;
                inTheaters = false;
            }
        }
