    .. code-block:: java

        public class Party
        {
            private int numInvited;
            private boolean partyCancelled;

            public Party()
            {
                numInvited = 1;
                partyCancelled = false;
            }

            public Party(int invites)
            {
                numInvited = invites;
                partyCancelled = false;
            }
        }
        I.   Party myParty;
        II.  int classSize = 20;
             Party ourParty = new Party(classSize);
        III. int numOfFriends = 6;
             Party yourParty = new Party(numOfFriends + 3.0);
