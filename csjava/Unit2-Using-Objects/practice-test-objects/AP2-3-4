    Consider the following class definition.

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Dog
        {
            public void bark()
            {
                System.out.print("Woof ");
            }

            public void wag()
            {
                System.out.print("Wag Tail ");
            }

            public void happy()
            {
                wag();
                bark();
            }
            /* Constructors not shown */
        }

    Which of the following code segments, if located in a method in a class other than Dog, will cause the message "Wag Tail Wag Tail Woof " to be printed?

    - .. code-block:: java

        Dog a = new Dog();
        a.bark();
        a.wag();

      - This would print "Woof Wag Tail "

    - .. code-block:: java

        Dog a = new Dog();
        Dog.happy();

      - You must use the object a, not the class name Dog, to call its methods.

    - .. code-block:: java

        Dog a = new Dog();
        a.happy();

      - This would print out "Wag Tail Woof ".

    - .. code-block:: java

        Dog a = new Dog();
        a.wag();
        a.happy();

      + This would print out "Wag Tail Wag Tail Woof ";

    - .. code-block:: java

         Dog a = new Dog();
         a.wag();

      - This would just print "Wag Tail ".
