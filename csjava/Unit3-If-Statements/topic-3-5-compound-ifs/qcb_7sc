   :answer_c: You will get a error because you can't divide by zero.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Since x is equal to zero the first expression in the complex conditional will be true and the (y / x) == 3 won't be evaluated, so it won't cause a divide by zero error.  It will print "first case".
   :feedback_b: Since x is equal to zero the first part of the complex conditional is true so it will print first case.
   :feedback_c: You won't get an error because of short circuit evaluation.  The (y / x) == 3 won't be evaluated since the first expression is true and an or is used.

   What is printed when the following code executes and x has been set to zero and y is set to 3?

   .. code-block:: java

     if (x == 0 || (y / x) == 3)
     {
        System.out.println("first case");
     }
     else
     {
        System.out.println("second case");
     }
