   :answer_a: return (numOfBoxes + priceOfOnePizzaBox) / numOfPeople;
   :answer_b: return numOfPeople * numOfBoxes * priceOfOnePizzaBox;.

   :feedback_a: Assume you have 5 boxes at $10 each. You would need to multiply them to get a total cost of $50. If you had 10 people at the party, you would need to divide $50 by 10 to get $5 per person.
   :feedback_b: Assume you have 5 boxes at $10 each for a total cost of $50. If you had 10 people at the party, you would need to divide $50 by 10 to get $5 per person.
   :feedback_c: Assume you have 5 boxes at $10 each. You would need to multiply them to get a total cost of $50. If you had 10 people at the party, you would need to divide $50 by 10 to get $5 per person.
   :feedback_d: Assume you have 5 boxes at $10 each for a total cost of $50. If you had 10 people at the party, you would need to divide $50 by 10 to get $5 per person.
   :feedback_e: Assume you have 5 boxes at $10 each for a total cost of $50. If you had 10 people at the party, you would need to divide $50 by 10 to get $5 per person.


   Consider the following class definition. The calculatePizzaCostPerPerson method is intended to calculate the amount each person at the party must pay for pizza. The amount is equal to the total price of all the pizza boxes divided by the number of people at the party. Which of the following code segments should replace *missing code* so that the calculatePizzaCostPerPerson method will work as intended?

   .. code-block:: java

        public class Party
        {
            private int numOfPeople; //number of people at the party

            public Party(int people)
            {
                numOfPeople = people;
            }

            public double calculatePizzaCostPerPerson(int numOfBoxes, double priceOfOnePizzaBox)
            {
                /* missing code */
            }
        }
