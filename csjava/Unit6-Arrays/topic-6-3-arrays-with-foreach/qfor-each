   What is the output of the following code segment?

   .. code-block:: java

      int[ ] numbers = {44, 33, 22, 11};
      for (int num : numbers)
      {
          num *= 2;
      }
      for (int num : numbers)
      {
          System.out.print(num + " ");
      }

   - 44 33 22 11

     + The array is unchanged because the foreach loop cannot modify the array elements.

   - 46 35 24 13

     - Remember that the foreach loop cannot modify the array elements, but it also uses multiplication, not addition.

   - 88 66 44 22

     - Remember that the foreach loop cannot modify the array elements. Only the variable num will be doubled, not the original array values.

   - The code will not compile.

     - This code will compile.
