   :answer_d: [c, d, e, a, b, f]
   :answer_e: [c, a, e, d, b, f]
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: What happened to the f?
   :feedback_b: This list is [a], then [a, b], then [c, a, b], then [c, d, a, b], then [c, d, e, b], then [c, d, e, b, f]
   :feedback_c: The a is pushed to position 2 and then replaced with the e.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was <code>list1.add(2,"e")</code>
   :feedback_e: Remember that the set will replace the value at index 2.

   What is printed as a result of executing the following code segment?

   .. code-block:: java

     List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<String>();
     list1.add("a");
     list1.add("b");
     list1.add(0,"c");
     list1.add(1, "d");
     list1.set(2, "e");
     list1.add("f");
     System.out.println(list1);
