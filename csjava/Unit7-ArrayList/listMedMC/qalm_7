   :answer_a: [2, 3, 4, 5]
   :answer_b: [2, 3, 5]
   :answer_c: [4, 2, 3, 5]
   :answer_d: [4, 2, 3, 4]
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it removed the first 4 but it removes the value at index 4.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it removed all the 4 values, but it removes the value at index 4.
   :feedback_c: This would be true if it removed the value at index 3.
   :feedback_d: This removes the value at index 4 which is 5.

   Given the list ``nums = [4, 2, 3, 4, 5]`` what is the result after executing ``nums.remove(4)``?
