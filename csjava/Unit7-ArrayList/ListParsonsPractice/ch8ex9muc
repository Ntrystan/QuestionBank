   The following program segment is a method that should take each String from an ArrayList of Strings (the parameter) and add it again to the list -- so {"cat", "ribbon", "house"} should become {"cat", "cat", "ribbon", "ribbon", "house", "house"}.  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>two extra blocks</b> that are not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution. </p>
