   Complete the program below to figure out a day of the week from 0-6 where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday for 7 days of the week. What value would you use for the divisor?
   ~~~~
   public class Mod
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        int day1 = 7;
        int day2 = 8;
        int day3 = 9;
        // fill in the divisor value below
        int divisor =   ;
        System.out.println("Remainder of " + day1 + "/" + divisor + " is " + (day1 % divisor) );
        System.out.println("Remainder of " + day2 + "/" + divisor + " is " + (day2 % divisor) );
        System.out.println("Remainder of " + day3 + "/" + divisor + " is " + (day3 % divisor) );
      }
   }
