   The following method should take an passed-in number and return a string such that only the even numbers are still present. All of the odd digits should be replaced with a "_" -- so 4321 should become "4_2_".  But the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>two extra blocks</b> that are not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
