   :answer_a: I and II are exactly equivalent for all input values n.
   :answer_b: I and II are only equivalent when n is an even number.
   :answer_c: I and II are only equivalent when n = 0
   :answer_d: I and II are equivalent for all values except when n = 0
   :answer_e: I and II are never going to have the exact same outputs.
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: I and II will never be equivalent because because count is incremented after it is printed in Code block I and before it is printed in Code block II.
   :feedback_b: I and II are not equivalent when n is even.
   :feedback_c: When n = 0, Code block I will print out 0, while Code block 2 will print out 1.
   :feedback_d: The code blocks never output the same value.
   :feedback_e: I and II will never be equivalent because count is incremented after it is printed in Code block I and before it is printed in Code block II.

   Given that both ``count`` and ``n`` are integer values, which of the following statements is true about both code blocks?

   .. code-block:: java

      // Code block I
      for (count = 0; count <= n; count++)
      {
          System.out.println(count);
      }

      //Code block II
      count = 0;
      while (count <= n)
      {
          count = count + 1;
          System.out.println(count);
      }
