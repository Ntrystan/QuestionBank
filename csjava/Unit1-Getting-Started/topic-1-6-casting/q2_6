   :answer_b: false
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Try casting to int instead of double.  What does that do?
   :feedback_b: Casting results in the type that you cast to. However, if you can't really cast the value to the specified type then you will get an error.

   True or false: casting always results in a double type.
