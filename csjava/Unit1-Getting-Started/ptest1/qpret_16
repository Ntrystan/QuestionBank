    :feedback_a: When you create a 2-d array the first value is the number of rows and the second is the number of columns. This code will put a 1 in the array when the row index is less than the column index and a 2 in the array when the row and column index are the same, and a 3 in the array when the row index is greater than the column index.
    :feedback_b: This would be true if the first value when you create a 2-d array was the number of columns and the second was the number of rows. Also you would need to set the value to 3 when the column index was greater than the row and a 1 when the row index was greater than the column index.
    :feedback_c: This would be true if the first value when you create a 2-d array was the number of columns and the second was the number of rows.
    :feedback_d: This would be true if you set the value to 3 when the column index was greater than the row and a 1 when the row index was greater than the column index.
    :feedback_e: This would be true if you set the value to the row index.

    Given the following code segment, What are the contents of ``mat`` after the code segment has been executed?

    .. code-block:: java

        int [][] mat = new int [3][4];
        for (int row = 0; row < mat.length; row++)
        {

           for (int col = 0; col < mat[0].length; col++)
           {
              if (row < col)
                 mat[row][col] = 1;
              else if (row == col)
                 mat[row][col] = 2;
              else
                 mat[row][col] = 3;
          }
        }
