    In the above example the type of x is |blank| and the type of  z is |blank|.

    - :Item: Is the correct answer
      :Object: Well, it is an Object but be more specific.
      :x: Try running the code and looking at the output.

    - :Object: Is the correct answer
      :Item: Is not correct.  JSON has no way to remember the  "user defined type" of an object.
      :x: Try running the code and looking at the output.
