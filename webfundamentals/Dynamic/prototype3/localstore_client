   What is the best way to arrange for our new LocalStorageSaver class to be a client of the model?

   - Make LocalStorageSaver a subclass of ShoppingList

     - No, although this could work it would tightly couple the model to a particular method of persistent storage.

   - Make the LocalStorage object a property of our model.

     - No, although we could make this work as well, it's not the best solution for our architecture.

   - Have the LocalStorageSaver object subscribe to the model

     + Corrrect!
