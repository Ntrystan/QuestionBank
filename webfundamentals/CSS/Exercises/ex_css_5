   Using the nav element, make a navbar for at the top of a sample webpage.  Add at least three links to the navbar using an unordered list that is displayed as inline rather than block.  Make the navbar have a light blue background color, but change the background of the title to a darker blue when the mouse hovers over it.  (see the `:hover selector <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp>`_)
