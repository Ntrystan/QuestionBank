   :answer_d: Error, the for statement needs to use the range function.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Iteration by item will process once for each item in the sequence, even the empty list.
   :feedback_b: Yes, there are nine elements in the list so the for loop will iterate nine times.
   :feedback_c: Iteration by item will process once for each item in the sequence. Each string is viewed as a single item, even if you are able to iterate over a string itself.
   :feedback_d: The for statement can iterate over a sequence item by item.

   How many times will the for loop iterate in the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

      p = [3, 4, "Me", 3, [], "Why", 0, "Tell", 9.3]
      for ch in p:
         print(ch)
