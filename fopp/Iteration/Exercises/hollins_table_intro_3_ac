   While ``i`` and ``j`` are standard iterator variables in this situation,
   ``row`` and ``col`` might be more descriptive. Also we can print the
   values of the table in a more readable format by using the named
   parameter  ``end`` of the ``print()`` function to change what is printed
   at the end of the line, which by default is the newline character ``\n``,
   to simply a space.  We then need a print statement within only the
   outer for loop in order to get each row to be on a new line.
   Check out the new code and run it.
