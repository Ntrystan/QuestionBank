   Cobalt-60, a radioactive form of cobalt used in cancer therapy, decays over a period of time. Each year, 12% of the amount present at the beginning of the year will have decayed. If a container of cobalt-60 initially contains 10 grams, determine the ``amount_remaining`` after five years. Use a for loop to solve, print the amount remaining after calculating.
