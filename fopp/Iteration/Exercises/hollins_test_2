    Write a program that iterates through each character of the string ``test_string`` and does the following. If the character is an ``"a"``, print ``You get an apple!``; if instead the character is a ``"b"``, print ``You get a banana!``; otherwise, print ``No fruit for you!`` Choose your variable name(s) appropriately. Just to be clear, your program should print as many lines as there are characters in ``test_string``.

    test_string = "abracadabra"
