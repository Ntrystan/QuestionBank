    ``addition_str`` is a string with a list of numbers separated by the ``+`` sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to take the sum of all of the numbers and assigns it to ``sum_val`` (an integer). (You should use the ``.split("+")`` function to split by ``"+"`` and ``int()`` to cast to an integer).

    ~~~~
    addition_str = "2+5+10+20"
