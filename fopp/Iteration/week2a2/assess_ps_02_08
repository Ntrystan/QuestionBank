    ``week_temps_f`` is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the ``,`` sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the **average** (sum divided by number of items) and assigns it to ``avg_temp``. Do not hard code your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or the number of items in ``week_temps_f``) (You should use the ``.split(",")`` function to split by ``","`` and ``float()`` to cast to a float).

    week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"
