   :answer_a: x = x + y
   :answer_b: y += x
   :answer_c: x += x + y
   :answer_d: x += y
   :answer_e: x++ y
   :correct: a,d
   :feedback_a: x is updated to be the old value of x plus the value of y.
   :feedback_b: y is updated to be the old value of y plus the value of x.
   :feedback_c: This updates x to be its old value (because of the +=) plus its old value again (because of the x on the right side) plus the value of y, so it's equivalent to x = x + x + y
   :feedback_d: x is updated to be the old value of x plus the value of y.
   :feedback_e: ++ is not a syntax that means anything in Python.
