    Thank you for signing up for the **Using Runestone Workshop!**  The response has been a bit overwhelming to say the least.  Barb and I had 17 people signed up for the workshop at SIGCSE and there are more than 225 people signed up for this week!  Things have certainly changed since March.

    A few logistics for getting started.

    We will convene online Monday afternoon at 3pm EDT  in a zoom meeting.  Here is the information.  We will use the same zoom meeting each afternoon.
