   Write a program to accept two integers ``a`` and ``b`` as the input. Output the lcm (least common multiple) of them. This program will not be auto graded (You tutor will grade it manually). To help you to verify the correctness of your program, here are some test cases you can use: lcm(16, 24) = 48, lcm(8, 12) = 24, lcm(6, 9) = 18, lcm(20, 28) = 140, lcm(18, 81) = 162

   # For this question, the input from the keyboard will not work due to some settings. However, you can use input like a = 2, b = 3
