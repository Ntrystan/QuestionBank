   Almost heaven, West Virginia
   Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
   Life is old there, older than the trees
   Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
   Country roads, take me home
   To the place I belong
   West Virginia, mountain mama
   Take me home, country roads
   All my memories gather round her
   Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
   Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
   Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
   Country roads, take me home
   To the place I belong
   West Virginia, mountain mama
   Take me home, country roads
   I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
   The radio reminds me of my home far away
   And driving down the road I get a feeling
   That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
   Country roads, take me home
   To the place I belong
   West Virginia, mountain mama
   Take me home, country roads
   Country roads, take me home
   To the place I belong
   West Virginia, mountain mama
   Take me home, country roads
   Take me home, down country roads
   Take me home, down country roads
