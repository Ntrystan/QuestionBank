   Consider the code below. From line ``1-5`` you have a function 
   called ``even`` that checks whether a number is even or not. If it 
   is even, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false. In 
   line ``7`` there is a variable called ``a`` and is initialized to value 
   ``4``. Modify the code below so to:

   1. Call function ``even`` to check whether ``a`` is even or not 
   and print the result to make sure you have it right.
   
   2. Increment ``a`` by one and call the function again and print 
   the result again.

   def even(num):
        if(num % 2 == 0):
               return True
        else:
               return False

   a = 4
