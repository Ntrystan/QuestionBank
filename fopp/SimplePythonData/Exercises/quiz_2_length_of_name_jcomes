   Write a program that does the following: (1) prompts the user for a name, 
   (2) stores the name provided by the user in a variable called ``name``, and then 
   (3) prints a message to the user telling them how many characters are in the name.
   
   For example, if the user enters the name Jonny, the program should tell them there are 5 
   characters in that name. If the user enters Dr. Danielson, the program should tell them there are 13 characters (including the period and the space).
