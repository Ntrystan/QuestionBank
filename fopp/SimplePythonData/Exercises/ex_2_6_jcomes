    It is possible to name the days 0 thru 6 where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday.
    If you go on a wonderful holiday leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday) and you return
    home after 10 nights you would return home on a Saturday (day 6).

    Write a general version of the program which (1) prompts the user for a starting day number 
    and the length of their stay, then (2) stores the values as type ``int`` variables 
    ``start_day`` and ``stay_length`` respectively, and finally (3) prints the 
    number of the day of the week they will return in an appropriate message.
