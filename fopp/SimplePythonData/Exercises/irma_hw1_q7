    Correct the code below that converts minutes into seconds. When a user provides a number of minutes, it outputs the minutes converted to seconds. E.g., when a user provides number 1, the output should be 60. Work until you get the right answer!
    ~~~~
    minutes = input(How many minutes?)
    NR SECONDS PER MINUTE = 24
    seconds = minutes x NR SECONDS PER MINUTE
    print("seconds")
