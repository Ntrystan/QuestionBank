    variable ``P``, assign to ``n`` the value 12, and assign to ``r`` the interest
    rate of 8% (0.08).  Then have the program prompt the user for the number of years,
    ``t``, that the money will be compounded for.  Calculate and print the final
    amount after ``t`` years.

    P = 10000
    n = 12
    r = 0.08

    t = ??
