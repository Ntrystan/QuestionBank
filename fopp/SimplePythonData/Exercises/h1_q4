    Initialize two variables to values ``9`` and ``2`` respectively. 
    Then:
    
    1. increment each variable first by value ``2`` (means you 
    update those variables)
    
    2. integer divide the two variables (divide the larger value with 
    the lower one), and assign the result to another variable called 
    ``c``
    
    3. print the variable ``c`` and make sure you have the desired 
    result
