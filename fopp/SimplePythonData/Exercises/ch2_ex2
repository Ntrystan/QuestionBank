   For the three expressions below in the box (line 5, line 7 and line 9), write their shorthand notations.
   ~~~~Write
   x = 2
   y = 3
   z = 4
   
   x = x + 1
   #write here your shorthand notation
   y = y * 2
   #write here your shorthand notation
   z = z + (y * 2)
   #write here your shorthand notation
   #print the values of variables if you're not sure. You need to get the same result for full and shorthand expressions
