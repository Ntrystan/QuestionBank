   :feedback_a: Neither Cheshire nor Cat defines an __init__ constructor method, so the grandaprent class, Pet, will have it's __init__ method called. Check how many instance variables it sets.
   :feedback_b: Neither Cheshire nor Cat defines an __init__ constructor method, so the grandaprent class, Pet, will have it's __init__ method called. Check how many instance variables it sets.
   :feedback_c: Neither Cheshire nor Cat defines an __init__ constructor method, so the grandaprent class, Pet, will have it's __init__ method called. Check how many instance variables it sets.
   :feedback_d: Neither Cheshire nor Cat defines an __init__ constructor method, so the grandaprent class, Pet, will have it's __init__ method called. That constructor method sets the instance variables name, hunger, boredom, and sounds.
