   :answer_a: The value 4.5 is displayed on the screen.
   :answer_b: The value 2.52 is displayed on the screen.
   :answer_c: A crash occurs because 2.5 is not a string
   :answer_d: A crash occurs because the expression 'msg + 2' illegally attempts to concatenate a str and an int
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! Python ignores the ': str' annotation and returns the sum of msg (the float 2.5) + 2.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect. In this call, msg contains the float value 2.5; the ': str' annotation serves only as documentation.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect. Python ignores the ': str' annotation and allows the float value 2.5 to be passed to msg.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect. In this call, msg contains the float value 2.5, not a str, so the + operation is legal.

   What happens when the following is executed?

   .. sourcecode:: python

        def display(msg: str):
            """Displays `msg` on the screen"""
            print(msg + 2)

        display(2.5)
