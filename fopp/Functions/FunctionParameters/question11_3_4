   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: No, x and y are the names of the formal parameters to this function.  When the function is called, it requires actual values to be passed in.
   :feedback_b: A function call always requires parentheses after the name of the function.
   :feedback_c: This function takes two parameters (arguments)
   :feedback_d: A colon is only required in a function definition.  It will cause an error with a function call.
   :feedback_e: Since z has the value 3, we have passed in two correct values for this function. "Greetings" will be printed 3 times.

   Considering the function below, which of the following statements correctly invokes, or calls, this function (i.e., causes it to run)?

   .. code-block:: python

      def print_many(x, y):
         """Print out string x, y times."""
         for i in range(y):
             print(x)

      z = 3
