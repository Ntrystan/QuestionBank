   :answer_c: Error: can't put a function invocation inside parentheses
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: It squares 2, yielding the value 4. But that doesn't mean the next value multiplies 2 and 4.
   :feedback_b: It squares 2, yielding the value 4. 4 is then passed as a value to square again, yeilding 16.
   :feedback_c: This is a more complicated expression, but still valid. The expression square(2) is evaluated, and the return value 4 substitutes for square(2) in the expression.

   What will the following code output?

   .. code-block:: python

       def square(x):
           y = x * x
           return y

       print(square(square(2)))
