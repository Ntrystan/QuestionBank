   Which of the following are local variables? Please, write them in order of what line they are on in the code.

   .. sourcecode:: python

    numbers = [1, 12, 13, 4]
    def foo(bar):
        aug = str(bar) + "street"
        return aug

    addresses = []
    for item in numbers:
        addresses.append(foo(item))


   The local variables are

   -  :bar: Good work!
      :aug: While aug is a local variable, it is not the first one in the code.
      :item: item is not a local variable.
      :.*: Incorrect, try again.
   -  :aug: Good work!
      :bar: While bar is a local variable, it is not the first one in the code.
      :item: item is not a local variable.
