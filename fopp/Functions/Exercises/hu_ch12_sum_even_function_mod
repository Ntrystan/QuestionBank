   Complete the definition of function ``sumEven`` below.

   The function takes a single list (``numList``) of integers. as its input.
   It should return the sum of all even numbers in that list.
   Your function should *not* produce any output, *i.e.* it
   should have no ``print`` statement.  It should merely *return* 
   its result as an integer.  You may assume the items in
   the list are all integers.  *Hint:* an integer is even if
   it is evenly divisible by 2.
