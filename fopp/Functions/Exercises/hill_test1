    Define a function called ``draw(turtle, shape, length)``.  If ``shape`` is “square”, use turtle to draw a square with side equal to ``length``. If ``shape`` is “triangle”, draw an equilateral triangle with side equal to ``length``. Otherwise, draw nothing.  The turtle should face in the same position after draw is done.  The function may return whatever you like.  Example usage: ``draw(myturtle, "triangle", 20)``.
