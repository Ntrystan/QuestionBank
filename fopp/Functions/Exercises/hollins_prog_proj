   This ActiveCode box is for you to write your program.
   There is no starter code, but you have all the guidelines
   and instructions you need in the assignment PDF, which is
   available on Moodle. You are allowed to use your Runestone
   textbook freely, but you are not allowed to use any other
   sources (nor are you allowed to get help from other people).
   Your program is due by Dec. 17 at 5:00 PM, but you can take
   as much time as you want until then (it does not need to be
   done in one sitting).
