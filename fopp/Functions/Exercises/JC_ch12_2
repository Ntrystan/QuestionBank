    Ask the user "How many circles?", then use the turtle library and a function you create called circles(x) to draw that many circles on a regular polygon. To get full credit, the circles MUST be placed on the corners of a regular polygon. For example, if the number of circles is 4, the 4 circles most be in the corners of a square. If the number is 3, the 3 circles must be place in the corners of a triangle.
