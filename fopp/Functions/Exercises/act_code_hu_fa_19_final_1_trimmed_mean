    *(5 points)* Define a Python *function* named
    ``trimmedMean(numList)`` that takes a list of 
    floating-point numbers as its input *(i.e.* ``numList``)
    and then calculates and returns the *trimmed mean* of that 
    list.  

    The trimmed mean excludes the outliers from the 
    list, *i.e.* it does not include the smallest and largest 
    numbers from the list when computing the 
    mean (average). In that way, a trimmed mean is more 
    representative of a dataset, with less interference 
    from the outliers.  Your function need not behave 
    well with lists of fewer than 3 elements, or if the 
    list has duplicates. Your function definition 
    should **not** include any ``print`` statements.  

    I have provided a main program that will test your 
    function--do *not* make any changes to my code.  
    (You may define additional functions if you wish; 
    but that is not required.)

    print("Trimmed mean of listOne = ", 
           trimmedMean(listOne))

    # should print "Trimmed mean of listTwo = 3.85"
    listTwo = [1.2, 3.4, 4.3, 9.5]
    print("Trimmed mean of listTwo = ", 
           trimmedMean(listTwo))
