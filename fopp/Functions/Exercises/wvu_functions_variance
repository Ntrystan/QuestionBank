   Variance can be calculated as **(∑(x−x̄)²)/n**, where **x̄** is the average of all **x** and **n** is the count of how many **x** there are.

   Standard deviation is the square root of variance.

   Write a function named **variance** that will return the variance of a list. Write a second function named **stdev** that will return the standard deviation of a list.
