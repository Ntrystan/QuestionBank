    What is the output of the following code fragment?

    .. sourcecode:: python

        def myfun(lst):
            lst = [1, 2, 3]

        mylist = ['a', 'b']
        myfun(mylist)
        print(mylist)

    - ['a', 'b']

      + Correct! ``mylist`` is not changed by the assignment in ``myfun``.

    - [1, 2, 3]

      - Incorrect. ``mylist`` is not changed by the assignment in ``myfun``.
