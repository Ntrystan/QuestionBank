    What is the output of the following code fragment?

    .. sourcecode:: python

        def myfun(lst):
            del lst[0]

        mylist = ['a', 'b']
        myfun(mylist)
        print(mylist)

    - ['a', 'b']

      - Incorrect. ``myfun`` alters the state of the list object by removing the value at slot 0.

    - ['b']

      + Correct! ``myfun`` alters the state of the list object by removing the value at slot 0.
