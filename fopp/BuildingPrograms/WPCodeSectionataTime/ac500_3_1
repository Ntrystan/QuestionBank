    # initialize a dictionary
    user_dictionary = {}
    print("---------- keys in user_dictionary: " + str(list(user_dictionary.keys())) + " ----------")

    # write a for loop that will iterate five times. I can use the range function for this!

    # in the for loop, I should ask for input from the user

    # next, I should separate the words

    # finally, I should add the key value pair to the dictionary
