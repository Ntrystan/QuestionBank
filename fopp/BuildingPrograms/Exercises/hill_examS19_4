    Write a function ``speak(animal,number)`` which takes in the name of an animal (either ``cow``, ``dog``, or ``pig``) and a number between 1 and 5, and prints their signature utterance (``moo``, ``woof``, or ``oink``) as many times as ``number`` says.  It should print an error message if you choose another animal, or if the number is outside the range above.
