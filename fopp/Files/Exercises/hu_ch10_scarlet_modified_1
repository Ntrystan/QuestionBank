   I have given you access to a text file named ``scarlet.txt``, 
   which is a file containing the entire text of Sir Arthur
   Conan Doyle's *A Study in Scarlet*, a Sherlock Holmes
   mystery.

   Your task is to find out how often the words *red* and
   *scarlet* appear in the story.  (Do not worry about 
   uppercase or mixed-case: assume the words in which you 
   are interested appear in all lowercase.)

   Assign to variable ``red_count`` the number of times the
   word "red" (no quotes) appears in the file; assign to
   variable ``scarlet_count`` the number of times the word
   "scarlet" (no quotes) appears in the file.
   
   Your program should not have any output, *i.e.* there 
   should be no ``print`` statements in your code. It should
   merely assign the values to the two variables as indicated. 
   I have started the code for you.
