    Assume that the final grade for a course is determined based on this scale - A: 900+ points, B: 800-899 points, C: 700-799 points, D: 600-699 points, F: 599 or fewer points.

    Write a function named **get_letter_grade()** that takes the number of points the student has earned as a parameter. It should return a string containing (only) the letter grade the student will receive.
