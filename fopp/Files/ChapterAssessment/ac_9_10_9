   Read in the contents of the file ``SP500.txt`` which has monthly data for 2016 and 2017 about the S&P 500 closing prices as well as some other financial indicators, including the "Long Term Interest Rate", which is interest rate paid on 10-year U.S. government bonds.

   Write a program that computes the average closing price (the second column, labeled SP500) and the highest long-term interest rate. Both should be computed only for the period from June 2016 through May 2017. Save the results in the variables ``mean_SP`` and ``max_interest``.
