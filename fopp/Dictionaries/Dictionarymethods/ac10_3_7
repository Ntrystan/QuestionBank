   **6.** We have a dictionary of the specific events that Italy has won medals in and the number of medals they have won for each event. Assign to the variable ``events`` a list of the keys from the dictionary ``medal_events``. Do not hard code this.

   medal_events = {'Shooting': 7, 'Fencing': 4, 'Judo': 2, 'Swimming': 3, 'Diving': 2}
