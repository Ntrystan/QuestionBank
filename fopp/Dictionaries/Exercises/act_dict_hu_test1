    Define a Python function named ``isEven`` that takes one parameter, an integer, and returns ``True`` if that integer is even and ``False`` if that integer is odd.  Then, below it, define a Python function ``numEvens`` that takes a list of integers (of any length), and returns the number of even integers in that list. Your second function should invoke your first.

    # replace with your definition of function 'isEven' here

    # replace with your definition of function 'isOdd' here


    # do *NOT* replace any of the code below; 
    # you can use it to test your functions

    aList = [1, 21, 53, 22, 0, 19, 22, 57, 48, 65]
    bLIst = [15, 9, 6, 23]
    print(numEvens(aList))    # this should print 4
    print(numEvens(bList))    # this should print 1
