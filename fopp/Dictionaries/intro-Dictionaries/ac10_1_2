   **4.** You are keeping track of olympic medals for Italy in the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics! At the moment, Italy has 7 gold medals, 8 silver metals, and 6 bronze medals. Create a dictionary called ``olympics`` where the keys are the types of medals, and the values are the number of that type of medals that Italy has won so far.
