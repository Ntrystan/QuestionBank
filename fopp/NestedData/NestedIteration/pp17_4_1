   Now try rearranging these code fragments to make a function that counts all the *leaf* items in a nested list like nested1 above, the items at the lowest level of nesting (8 of them in nested1).
   -----
   def count_leaves(n):
   =====
       count = 0
   =====
       for L in n:
   =====
           for x in L:
   =====
               count = count + 1
   =====
       return count
