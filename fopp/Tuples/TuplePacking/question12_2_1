   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: julia is a tuple, not a dictionary; indexes must be integers.
   :feedback_b: [-1] picks out the last item in the sequence.
   :feedback_c: Index into tuples using square brackets. julia(-1) will try to treat julia as a function call, with -1 as the parameter value.
   :feedback_d: Index into tuples using square brackets. julia(-1) will try to treat julia as a function call, with -1 as the parameter value.
   :feedback_e: Indexing starts at 0. You want the seventh item, which is julia[6]
