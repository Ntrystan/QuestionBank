    Write a program that asks the user to enter a key (scrambled alphabet) and a message to encrypt or decrypt.  If you work with a partner one can work on decrypting and the other can work on encrypting.  Your program should output either the encrypted or decrypted message.  If you are the encrypter then email the encrypted message to your partner for them to decrypt.  If you are working alone then store the decrypted message in a variable to decrypt.
