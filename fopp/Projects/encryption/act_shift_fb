    What was the original shift?

    - :17: Is the correct answer!
      :9: Close, 9 is the amount you had to shift to get it back but its not symmetric.  Think about reversing the shift...
      :x: Try again, You should print out the amount you are rotating along with the string.  You'll need to find one that makes sense.
