   :answer_a: Yes
   :answer_b: No
   :feedback_a: Correct! There is an issue with the getKnowledge method because it returns None when self.knowledge is 0, even though it returns the correct value when self.knowledge is non-zero.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect, there are more cases that fail. Try finding those other cases!
   :correct: a

   Are there any other cases, that we can determine based on the current structure of the class, that also fail for the Student class?
