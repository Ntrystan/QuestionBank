   **1.** You will be sorting the following list by each element's second letter, a to z. Create a function to use when sorting, called ``second_let``. It will take a string as input and return the second letter of that string. Then sort the list,  create a variable called ``sorted_by_second_let`` and assign the sorted list to it. Do not use lambda.

   ex_lst = ['hi', 'how are you', 'bye', 'apple', 'zebra', 'dance']
