   The buggy code below prints out the value of the sport in the list ``sport``. Use try/except so that the code will run properly. If the sport is not in the dictionary, ``ppl_play``, add it in with the value of 1.

   sport = ["hockey", "basketball", "soccer", "tennis", "football", "baseball"]

   ppl_play = {"hockey":4, "soccer": 10, "football": 15, "tennis": 8}

   for x in sport:

        print(ppl_play[x])
