   **Turtles and Random:** Write a turtle program that generates a random number of sides for a polygon between 3 and 8 
   (from triangle to octagon). If the number of sides is even, draw two regular polygons with 
   that many sides, side by side, colored blue. If the number of sides is odd, draw two 
   regular polygons with that many sides, side by side, one colored blue and the other red.
   Extra Credit:  employ functions in your program.
