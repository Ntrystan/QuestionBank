   :answer_a: The turtle class.
   :answer_b: The same turtle that is used in each drawing your programs make.
   :answer_c: A unique 'turtle' that you can use to draw.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Though each instance does use the turtle class, this is not the best answer.
   :feedback_b: Each instance that is made using the turtle class is unique. Remember how you can have multiple 'turtles' in a single drawing? Each of those are different turtles but they are all instances of the turtle class.
   :feedback_c: Yes, an instance of the turtle class represents a unique turtle. The turtle class is like a stencil or mold that can be used to make as many turtles as you would like.
