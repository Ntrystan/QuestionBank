    Consider the list below in the activecode. Write the expressions doing the following:

    1. Print letter 'C' from this list 
    2. Print letters 'C', 'D', 'E'
    3. Print the length of this list
    4. Print the first element of this list
    5. Print the last element of this list
    6. Create a variable called grade and assign the third element  ('C') from list letters list to it (print variable grade to make sure you did the right indexing)
    
    Warning: for all printouts use indexing and the name of the 
    list (letters).  You cannot do print('C')!
