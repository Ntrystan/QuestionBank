    Create a copy of the temps list such that it has all the temperature values in temps,
    but reduced by 10. The copy is called lower_temps and starts as an empty list. 
    Use a for loop to iterate through the temps list and keep building lower_temps list.
    ~~~~
    temps = [95, 87, 100, 84, 78]
    lower_temps = []
