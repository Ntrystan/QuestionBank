   We want to concatenate the elements of parts into a new variable named wv. Include spaces between each part.
   ~~~~
   parts = ["West Virginia was created in",
            1863,
            "when 50 counties broke away from Virginia. Today there are",
            "55",
            "counties in the state."]

   # Create a variable named wv containing the concatenated string

   ====
   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

       def testOne(self):
           self.assertEqual(wv,"West Virginia was created in 1863 when 50 counties broke away from Virginia. Today there are 55 counties in the state.","Your string isn't concatenated as expected.")
