    Create a string representing a quote from the first black woman in space Mae Jemison. She said: "We look at science as something very elite, which only a few people can learn. That's just not true. You just have to start early and give kids a foundation. Kids live up, or down, to expectations." Now use the split function to split this quote into four pieces based on the occurrence of the period punctuation.
