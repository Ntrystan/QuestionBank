    Add a **__repr__()** function to the **Vehicle** class to return a string representation of object contents when used with a list. Your **__repr__()** function should call **__str__()** and return the string representation that function provides. You can copy-and-paste your **__str__()** function code into this question.

    Create a list containing two instances of the **Vehicle** class to represent vehicles of your choice. Print the contents of the list.

    class Vehicle:
        def __init__(self, year, make, model):
            self.year = year
            self.make = make
            self.model = model
