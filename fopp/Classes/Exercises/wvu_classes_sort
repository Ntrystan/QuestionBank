    Add a function called **sort_order()** to the **Vehicle** class. It should return the vehicle's make, model, and year like "Dodge Journey 2015" to facilitate sorting vehicles in that order.

    Copy-and-paste the **__str__()** and **__repr__()** functions from a previous question.

    Create a list containing three or more instances of the **Vehicle** class to represent vehicles of your choice. Sort the list on the **sort_order()** results and print the sorted list.

    class Vehicle:
        def __init__(self, year, make, model):
            self.year = year
            self.make = make
            self.model = model
