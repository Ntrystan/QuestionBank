    Add a **clone()** function to the **Vehicle** class to return a new **Vehicle** instance that duplicates the contents of the existing vehicle.

    Create an instance of the **Vehicle** class to represent a vehicle of your choice. Then, use the **clone()** method to make a duplicate of that vehicle.

    class Vehicle:
        def __init__(self, year, make, model):
            self.year = year
            self.make = make
            self.model = model
