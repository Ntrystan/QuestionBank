   Below, we have provided a simple class code for a point (Click show code to see the code for class). Set x to 10 and y to 5 for the the point p and x=15 and y = 20 for the point q.


   ~~~~

   class Point:
   """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """

       def __init__(self):

       self.x = 0
       self.y = 0

    p = Point()         # Instantiate an object of type Point
    q = Point()         # and make a second point

    print("Nothing seems to have happened with the points")
