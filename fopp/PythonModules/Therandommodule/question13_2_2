   :answer_a: There is no computer on the stage for the drawing.
   :answer_b: Because computers don’t really generate random numbers, they generate pseudo-random numbers.
   :answer_c: They would just generate the same numbers over and over again.
   :answer_d: The computer can’t tell what values were already selected, so it might generate all 5’s instead of 5 unique numbers.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: They could easily put one there.
   :feedback_b: Computers generate random numbers using a deterministic algorithm.  This means that if anyone ever found out the algorithm they could accurately predict the next value to be generated and would always win the lottery.
   :feedback_c: This might happen if the same seed value was used over and over again, but they could make sure this was not the case.
   :feedback_d: While a programmer would need to ensure the computer did not select the same number more than once, it is easy to ensure this.

   One reason that lotteries don’t use computers to generate random numbers is:
