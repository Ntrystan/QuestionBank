   The foot (pl. feet; abbreviation: ft; symbol: â€², the prime symbol) is a unit of length 
   in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement. Since the International Yard and Pound 
   Agreement of 1959, one foot is defined as 0.3048 meter exactly. In customary and imperial units, 
   the foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard. Write a program to convert square ft to
   square meters.
