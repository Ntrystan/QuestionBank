   Write a program to swap two integers. Your program should accept two inputs ``a`` and ``b``.
   When printing the value a and b, their value should be swapped. For example, if a = 1, b = 2, 
   after the swapping, and print(a), you should get 2, and print(b), you should get 1. 
   If a = 100, b = -100, after the swapping, print(a) yields -100 and print(b) yields 100. 
   You get the idea. This question will be graded manually. But you should be able to tell 
   whether your program is correct or not.
