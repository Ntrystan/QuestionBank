   Write code that asks the user to enter a numeric score (0-100). In response, it should print out the score and corresponding letter grade, according to the table below.

   .. table::

      =======   =====
      Score     Grade
      =======   =====
      >= 90     A
      [80-90)   B
      [70-80)   C
      [60-70)   D
      < 60      F
      =======   =====

   The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals.
   A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.
