    Given the following list and the indication of your favorite, write a program using conditional statements that will, for each dessert, say if it is your favorite dessert or not. Use a for loop and == to check whether a dessert equals your favorite dessert. Your code should print the following sentences:
   
    ice cream is not my favorite dessert 

    chocolate is not my favorite dessert 

    apple crisp is my favorite dessert

    cookies is not my favorite dessert
   
    ~~~~
    desserts = ['ice cream', 'chocolate', 'apple crisp', 'cookies']
    favorite_dessert = 'apple crisp'
