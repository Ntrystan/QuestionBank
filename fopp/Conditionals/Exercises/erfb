    Write a function called fizzbuzz() that takes one parameter, 
    length.
    Inside the function, count up to length in a loop.  Print
    numbers sequentially EXCEPT numbers divisible by 3 or 5.  
    If a number is divisible by 3, print "fizz" instead.  If a 
    number is divisible by 5, print "buzz".  If a number is divisible
    by both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz".  Example output is below.
