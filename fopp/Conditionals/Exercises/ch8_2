    Given a list of desserts ['ice cream', 'chocolate', 'apple crisp', 'cookies'] and your favorite dessert 'apple crisp' below, write a program using conditional statements that will for each dessert in list desserts capitalize its first letter and say if it is your favorite dessert or not. Hint: you need to use capitalize() method, for loops and use == to check whether a dessert equals your favorite dessert. Your code should print the following sentences:
   
    Ice cream is not my favorite dessert. 

    Chocolate is not my favorite dessert. 

    Apple crisp is my favorite dessert.

    Cookies is not my favorite dessert.
   
    ~~~~
    desserts = ['ice cream', 'chocolate', 'apple crisp', 'cookies']
    favorite_dessert = 'apple crisp'
