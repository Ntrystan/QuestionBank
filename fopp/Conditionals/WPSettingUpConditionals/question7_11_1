   :feedback_a: Using if/else either uses an unnecessary else statement or would improperly keep track of one of the accumulator variables.
   :feedback_b: Using if/elif means that words that have both a "t" and a "z" would not be propperly counted by the two variables.
   :feedback_c: Yes, two if statements will keep track of - and properly update - the two different accumulator variables.
   :feedback_d: Using if/elif/else here will provide an unnecessary else statement and improperly update one of the accumulator variables in the case where a word has both a "t" and a "z".
