   :answer_c: Output c
   :answer_d: It will cause an error because every if must have an else clause.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Because -10 is less than 0, Python will execute the body of the if-statement here.
   :feedback_b: Python executes the body of the if-block as well as the statement that follows the if-block.
   :feedback_c: Python will also execute the statement that follows the if-block (because it is not enclosed in an else-block, but rather just a normal statement).
   :feedback_d: It is valid to have an if-block without a corresponding else-block (though you cannot have an else-block without a corresponding if-block).

   What does the following code print?

   .. code-block:: python

     x = -10
     if x < 0:
         print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
     print("This is always printed")

   ::

     a.
     This is always printed

     b.
     The negative number -10 is not valid here
     This is always printed

     c.
     The negative number -10 is not valid here
