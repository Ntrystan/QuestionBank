    Write code that will count the number of vowels in the sentence ``s`` and assign the result to the variable ``num_vowels``. For this problem, vowels are only a, e, i, o, and u. Hint: use the ``in`` operator with ``vowels``.
    ~~~~
    s = "singing in the rain and playing in the rain are two entirely different situations but both can be fun"
    vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']

    # Write your code here.
