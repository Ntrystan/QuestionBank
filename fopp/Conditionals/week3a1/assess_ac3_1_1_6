   Create one conditional so that if "Friendly" is in ``w``, then "Friendly is here!" should be assigned to the variable ``wrd``. If it's not, check if "Friend" is in ``w``. If so, the string "Friend is here!" should be assigned to the variable ``wrd``, otherwise "No variation of friend is in here." should be assigned to the variable ``wrd``. (Also consider: does the order of your conditional statements matter for this problem? Why?)
   ~~~~
   w = "Friendship is a wonderful human experience!"
