    ``rainfall_mi`` is a string that contains the average number of inches of rainfall in Michigan for every month (in inches) with every month separated by a comma.
    Write code to compute the number of months that have more than 3 inches of rainfall. Store the result in the variable ``num_rainy_months``.
    In other words, count the number of items with values ``> 3.0``.


    Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.
