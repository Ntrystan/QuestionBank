   :feedback_a: True and False are both Boolean literals.
   :feedback_b: The comparison between two numbers via == results in either True or False (in this case False), both Boolean values.
   :feedback_c:  3+4 evaluates to 7, which is a number, not a Boolean value.
   :feedback_d: 3+4 evaluates to 7.  7 == 7 then evaluates to True, which is a Boolean value.
   :feedback_e: With the double quotes surrounding it, False is interpreted as a string, not a Boolean value. If the quotes had not been included, False alone is in fact a Boolean value.
