.. activecode:: wvu_moreiter_validation

    While loops are commonly used to validate user input. Write code that asks users to enter their age. If they enter a value less than 0 or more than 120, they should be reprompted again until they enter a valid value. When a valid answer is entered, print a message displaying the person's age.

    The input function should only be called on one line of code in your program.
