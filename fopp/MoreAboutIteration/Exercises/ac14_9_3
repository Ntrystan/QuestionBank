   Using a while loop, create a list called ``nums`` that contains the numbers 0 though 20. (i.e: your while looop should initialize a counter variable on 0. During each iteration, the loop should append the current value of the counter variable to ``nums`` and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than 20)
