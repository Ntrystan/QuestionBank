   :answer_a: n starts at 10 and is incremented by 1 each time through the loop, so it will always be positive
   :answer_b: answer starts at 1 and is incremented by n each time, so it will always be positive
   :answer_c: You cannot compare n to 0 in while loop.  You must compare it to another variable.
   :answer_d: In the while loop body, we must set n to False, and this code does not do that.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The loop will run as long as n is positive.  In this case, we can see that n will never become non-positive.
   :feedback_b: While it is true that answer will always be positive, answer is not considered in the loop condition.
   :feedback_c: It is perfectly valid to compare n to 0.  Though indirectly, this is what causes the infinite loop.
   :feedback_d: The loop condition must become False for the loop to terminate, but n by itself is not the condition in this case.
   :practice: T

   The following code contains an infinite loop. Which is the best explanation for why the loop does not terminate?

   .. code-block:: python

     n = 10
     answer = 1
     while ( n > 0 ):
       answer = answer + n
       n = n + 1
     print(answer)
