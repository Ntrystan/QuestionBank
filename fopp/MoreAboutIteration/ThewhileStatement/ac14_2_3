    Below, we've provided a for loop that sums all the elements of ``list1``. Write code that accomplishes the same task, but instead uses a while loop. Assign the accumulator variable to the name ``accum``.
    ~~~~

    list1 = [8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

    tot = 0
    for elem in list1:
        tot = tot + elem
