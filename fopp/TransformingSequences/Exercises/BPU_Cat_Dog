   You are supplied with a string ``s`` below. Write code that will swap cat with dog and vice versa.  The final output should be a string that says 'The dog ate the cat food, it was YUMMY!'

           self.assertTrue(newS==s.strip().lower().replace('cat','dog'), 'Correct string created')
           self.assertTrue('the dog ate the dog food, it was yummy!' not in self.getEditorText(), 'The string was not hard coded')
