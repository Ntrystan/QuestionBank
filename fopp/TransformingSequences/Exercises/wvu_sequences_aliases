   Create an alias named **cities** that points to the same list as the existing **municipalities** variable. Then, create a list named **towns** that is a clone of **cities**. **towns** and **cities** should be independent objects and not aliases.

   Once you have created the lists, change "Blacksville" in **municipalities** to "Town of Blacksville". Print out the content of element 4 in each list.

   municipalities = ['Morgantown', 'Star City', 'Westover', 'Granville', 'Blacksville']
