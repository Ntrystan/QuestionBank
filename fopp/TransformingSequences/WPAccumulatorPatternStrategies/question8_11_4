   :answer_a: Yes; "vowels in the sentence"
   :answer_b: Yes; "code that will count"
   :answer_c: No
   :feedback_a: Not quite - these words don't necessarily mean that we want to do sum accumulation.
   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: In this case, an accumulation pattern would be good to use!
   :correct: b
   :practice: T

   Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern? If so, what words indicate that? Write code that will count the number of vowels in the sentence ``s`` and assign the result to the variable ``num_vowels``.
