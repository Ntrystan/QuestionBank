   :answer_a: Yes; "save... to a list"
   :answer_b: Yes; "add 'ed' to the end of the word"
   :answer_c: No
   :feedback_a: Correct!
   :feedback_b: Not quite - these words don't necessarily mean that we want to accumulate the new strings into a new variable.
   :feedback_c: In this case, an accumulation pattern would be good to use!
   :correct: a
   :practice: T

   Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern? If so, what words indicate that? For each string in ``wrds``, add 'ed' to the end of the word (to make the word past tense). Save these past tense words to a list called ``past_wrds``.
