   :answer_d: Error, you cannot concatenate inside an append.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Don't forget the last item!
   :feedback_b: Yes, the for loop processes each item in lst. 5 is added before lst[i] is appended to new_list.
   :feedback_c: 5 is added to each item before the append operation is performed.
   :feedback_d: It is OK to have a complex expression inside the call to the append method. The expression `lst[i]+5` is fully evaluated before the append operation is performed.

   What is printed by the following statements?

   .. code-block:: python

     lst= [3,0,9,4,1,7]
     new_list=[]
     for i in range(len(lst)):
        new_list.append(lst[i]+5)
     print(new_list)
