   What will be the value of ``a`` after the following code has executed?

   .. sourcecode:: python

    a = ["holiday", "celebrate!"]
    quiet = a
    quiet.append("company")


   The value of ``a`` will be

   -  :\[["']holiday["'], ["']celebrate!["'], ["']company["']\]: Good work!
      :\[["']holiday["'], ["']celebrate!["']\]: This is the old value of a - a has changed.
      :.*: Incorrect, try again. Don't forget to include a space between list elements.
