   :feedback_a: Yes, num_lst is good for a sequence variable if the value is actually a list of numbers.
   :feedback_b: No, p is not likely to be a clear name for the iterator variable.
   :feedback_c: Yes, this is good to use if the for loop is iterating through a string.
   :feedback_d: Yes, names is good, assuming that the for loop is iterating through actual names and not something unrelated to names.
   :feedback_e: At least one of the answers above is a good name for a sequence variable
