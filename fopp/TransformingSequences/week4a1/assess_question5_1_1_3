   :feedback_a: Yes, this is the iterator variable. It changes each time but is not the whole sequence itself.
   :feedback_b: This is the sequence that we iterate over.
   :feedback_c: This is the accumulator variable. By the end of the program, it will have the total value of the integers that are in lst.

   Which of these is the iterator (loop) variable?

   .. sourcecode:: python

    lst = [5, 10, 3, 8, 94, 2, 4, 9]
    num = 0
    for item in lst:
        num += item
