   :answer_a: .insert()
   :answer_b: .pop()
   :answer_c: .append()
   :answer_d: .remove()
   :feedback_a: While you can use insert, it is not the best method to use because you need to specify that you want to stick the new item at the end.
   :feedback_b: pop removes an item from a list
   :feedback_c: Yes, though you can use insert to do the same thing, you don't need to provide the position.
   :feedback_d: remove gets rid of the first occurance of any item that it is told. It does not add an item.
