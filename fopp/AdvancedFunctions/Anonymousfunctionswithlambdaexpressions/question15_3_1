   :answer_a: A string with a - in front of the number.
   :answer_b: A number of the opposite sign (positive number becomes negative, negative becomes positive).
   :answer_c: Nothing is returned because there is no return statement.
   :correct: b

   :feedback_b: Correct!
   :feedback_c: Remember, lambda functions do not use return statements.
