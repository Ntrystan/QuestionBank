   You are probably already familiar with the idea of 'rounding' a number to the nearest integer. Python has a built-in function for this, but it would be helpful to think about how you might write such an algorithm yourself. Remember that when we round a number to the nearest integer, we are either making it larger or smaller depending on whether the decimal part of its value is greater or less than 0.5.

   **Complete the code below to create a program that:**
   
   #. asks the user for a decimal value, 
   #. stores it as a float, 
   #. rounds it to the nearest integer, and 
   #. prints the response.

   **NOTE: The IF statement is not permitted. Likewise, comparison operators are not permitted. You should do this using just the basic operators you have studied so far.**

   user_float = float(input("Please enter a number with a decimal:\n"))

   # YOUR CODE HERE

   rounded = 0 # FIXME

   print("The nearest integer is:", rounded)
