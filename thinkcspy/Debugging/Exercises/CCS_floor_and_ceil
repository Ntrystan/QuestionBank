.. activecode:: CCS_floor_and_ceil

   The "floor" operation takes any decimal input and returns the largest integer that is smaller than the input. For example, if the input is 1.2, the floor of 1.2 is 1. If the input is 1.5, the floor is also 1 and if the input is .9999 the floor is 0.

   The "ceil" operation, on the other hand, takes any decimal input and returns the smallest integer larger than the input (i.e. like the "ceiling"). Therefore we say the ceil of 1.9 is 2. The ceil of 1.5 is also 2. The ceil of 1.00001 is 2.

   Python has functions to calculate the floor and the ceil but it is not hard to implement simple versions of them yourself, so that is what we will do.

   Complete the code below to create a program that asks the user for any decimal input and prints the floor of that input and the ceil of that input.

   **NOTE: The IF statement is not permitted. Likewise, comparison operators are not permitted. You should do this using just the basic operators you have studied so far.**

   #YOUR CODE HERE

   floor = 0 #FIXME
   ceil  = 0 #FIXME

   print("The floor is:", floor)

   print("The ceil is:", ceil)
