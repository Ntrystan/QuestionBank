.. activecode:: CCS_dynamic_padding

   **Complete the code below to create a program that asks the user to specify a total width that numbers should be padded to and then asks the enter to enter a number with equal or fewer digits than the width given by the first input.** 
   
   For example, if the user specifies a padding width of 3 the program should then ask the user to enter a number between 0 and 999. If the width is 4, it should ask for a number between 0 and 9,999.
   
   (The prompt should be specific about the range of numbers that are allowed. I.e. don't just say "Now enter a number with equal or fewer digits than the number you just entered.")
   
   **Finally, pad the number with zeros on the left until it is the correct length based on the user's input.**
   
   **NOTE: The IF statement is not permitted.**
