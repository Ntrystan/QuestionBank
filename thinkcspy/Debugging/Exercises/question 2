    :feedback_d: There's definitely an error

    This code looks correct, but something is up. What type of error is it? 

    import turtle

    wn = turtle.Screen()    
         
    wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

    tess = turtle.Turtle()          

    tess.color("hotpink")

    tess.pensize(5)

    alex = Turtle.Turtle()           

    tess.forward(80)
                 
    tess.left(120)

    tess.forward(80)

    tess.left(120)   
                
    wn.exitonclick()
