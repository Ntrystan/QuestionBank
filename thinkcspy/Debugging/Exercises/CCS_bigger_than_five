   **Write a program that asks the user to enter a digit between 0 and 9.**
   
   * If the number is five or greater, your program should print 1. 
   
   * If the number is smaller than 0, your program should print 0.
   
   **NOTE: The IF statement is not permitted. Likewise, comparison operators are not permitted. You should do this using just the basic operators you have studied so far.**
