   **[20 pts] Question 1(c)** In the above scenario [Question 1(b)], both quizzes have the same weight. Suppose Quiz 1 counts for 60% of the quiz grade and Quiz 2 counts for 40% of the quiz grade. The relative weight of the quizzes and final should stay the same. Modify the program to reflect this change. For example, if quiz1 = 100, quiz2 = 60, final = 71, your class grade is 77.5.

   [HINT: State the expression for the final grade before starting to code]
