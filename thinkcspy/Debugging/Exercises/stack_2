    :feedback_a: Good job. line 1 is missing a : and line 2 needs to be indented.
    :feedback_b: Not a name error.
    :feedback_c: Not a type error
    :feedback_d: There's definitely an error

    This code looks correct, but something is up. What type of error is it? 

    for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]
            print("Hi", name, "Please come to my party on Saturday!")
