    Update the previous program to compute take home pay instead of just salary. 
    Take home pay is how much money you get after taxes, benefits, and other 
    obligations are taken out.

    Let’s say taxes account for 30% of your deductions and benefits account 
    for another 7%. Also assume this job has no paid vacation or sick time, so if 
    this employee missed a day of work due to illness, family illness, or vacation, 
    they lose one day’s worth of pay.
