   **[20 pts] Question 1(a&b)** Consider the following program that computes a student' final score based on 2 quizzes, weighted equally,  that count for a total of 50% and a final that counts for  the remaining 50%::

   
      quiz1 = int(input('Enter Quiz 1 grade: '))
      quiz2 = int(input('Enter Quiz 2 grade: '))
      final = input('Enter exam grade: ')

      quiz_average = ((quiz1 + quiz2) / 2

      total = quiz_average*0.5 + final*0.5

      print('Your class grade is:', "total")



   (a) Can you discover any errors? List any errors you discover with line number and the nature of the error.  State if they are a syntax, runtime, or logic error. [Answer as comments in the answer section of the book]

   (b) Correct any errors you discover. Run the program and state the result for input scores: quiz1 = 100, quiz2 = 60, final = 71.  Verify by hand calculation if the result is correct.
