    Write a function 'drawRec' that draws a rectangle. Write another function 
    'randGen' that receives two random numbers as arguments and calls 
    'drawRec' to draw a rectangle with that random height and width.
 
    +0.25 Draw 10 rectangles of random sizes in random locations. 
    +0.25 Ask the user for a height and width. Call 'drawRec' to draw the 
    rectangle. Use an Accumulator Pattern to decrease the size of the height 
    and width by 2 and draw the rectangle in a random location. Repeat this 
    20 times.
