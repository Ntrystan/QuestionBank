    Assignment 7.  Circle

    Define two functions:  circleA and circleC

    circArea (rad) will calculate area of a circle using the radius
    
    It will Return the area.  
    
      myArea = 3.14 * (rad ** 2)

    circCircum (rad) will calculate circumference of a circle using the radius
    
    It will Return the area.  

      myCircum = 2 * 3.14 * rad


    Input a radius for a 1st circle.  
    Calculate and print the area and circumference

    Input a radius for a 2nd circle.  
    Calculate and print the area and circumference of the 2nd circle
