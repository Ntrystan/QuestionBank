.. activecode:: CCS1_func_all_squares
   
    Use the same area_of_square function as before, but now create another function called all_squares_between that takes two integers, **start** and **end** and prints out the squares of all numbers between start and end, each on a separate line. The second function should use a **for ... in** statement and it should also call **your** area_of_square function to calculate the squares.

    def area_of_square(side):
        # your code here
    
    def all_squares_between(start,end):
        # your code here

    all_squares_between(2,10)

    If the functions are right, you should get the following output:
