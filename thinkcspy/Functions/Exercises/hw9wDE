   **Homework 9 part b**

    You are to write a function, call it  ``main()``. When a user runs this function it will ask the user for a word of arbitrary length. Therefore you cannot put the ``input`` command outside the function, it has to run when the function is called. The function then **returns** the sum of the ASCII codes for that word, so your function body must end with a return statement. You must use a container variable and a for loop. HINT: The container itself will be a local variable, so it must be defined inside (and only inside) the function definition.
