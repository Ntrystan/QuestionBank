    Create a class called ``Cereal`` that has three instance variables: ``name``, ``brand``, and ``fiber``.
    When an instance of ``Cereal`` is printed, the user should see the following:
    "[name] cereal is produced by [brand] and has [fiber] grams of fiber in every serving!"
    To the variable name ``c1``, assign an instance of ``Cereal`` whose name is **Corn Flakes**,
    brand is **Kellogg's**, and fiber is 2. To the variable name ``c2``, assign an instance of
    ``Cereal`` whose name is **Honey Nut Cheerios**, brand is **General Mills**, and fiber is 3.
    Practice printing both!
