    Create a class called ``bank`` that contains two instance variables, ``name`` and
    ``amt``. Add the instance method, ``__str__``, that allows you to customize the message returned
    when you print the instance so that it says "Your account, [name goes here], has [start_amt goes here] dollars."
    Create an instance of this class with "Bob" as the name and 100 as the amount.
    Save this to the variable ``t1``.
