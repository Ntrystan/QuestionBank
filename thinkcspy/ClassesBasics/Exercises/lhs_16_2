    The equation of a straight line is  "y = ax + b", (or perhaps "y = mx + b").
    The coefficients ``a`` and ``b`` completely describe the line.  Write a method ``get_line_to(aPoint)`` in the
    ``Point`` class so that if a point instance is given another point, it will compute the equation
    of the straight line joining the two points.  It must return the two coefficients ``a`` and ``b`` **as a tuple**
    of two values.  For example,   ::

       >>> print(Point(4, 11).get_line_to(Point(6, 15)))
       >>> (2, 3)

    This tells us that the equation of the line joining the two points is "y = 2x + 3".
    When will your method fail?
