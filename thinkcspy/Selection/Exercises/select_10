    Write a nested conditional statement that checks if a variable 'num' is equal 
    to 5. When 'num' is not equal to 5, then the algorithm checks if 'num' is less 
    than 5. If 'num' is less than 5 the program prints out "num is less than 5." Or 
    else the program will print out "num is greater than 5."
