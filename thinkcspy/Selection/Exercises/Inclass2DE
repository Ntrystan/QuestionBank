   **In Class exercise 2**

    
    Write a program ``main()`` that asks the user to input a name with first letter capitalized. If the first letter is in the A-M range, print "First half of alphabet." If the first letter is in the N-Z range, print "Second half of alphabet". You can call your program main(), then invoke main() at the bottom of the page.

   def main():
       name = input("Enter your name, first letter in Capitals    ")



   main()
