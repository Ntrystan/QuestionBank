   **Homework 11 part b**

    First write a short program (does not have to be a function) using the **random** module that generates 10 random numbers from 1 to 50.  Next, modify the program to do the following: generate 10 random numbers from 1 to 50, write the even ones to a file named ``evens.txt`` and the odd ones to a file named ``odds.txt``. Duplicates may occur and are allowed. Extra Credit: eliminate duplicates.
