   [30 pts] Write a function ``isLeap`` that takes as argument an integer representing a given year.  The function should return ``True`` if the year is a leap year, ``False`` otherwise.  In doing so, 3 criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

   The year is evenly divisible by 4;

   If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;

   The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

   To test your function, write a program that asks the user for the year, calls your function, and prints the returned value.
