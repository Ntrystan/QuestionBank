   :answer_a: Output a
   :answer_b: Output b
   :answer_c: Output c
   :answer_d: It will cause an error because every if must have an else clause.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Because -10 is less than 0, Python will execute the body of the if-statement here.
   :feedback_b: Python executes the body of the if-block as well as the statement that follows the if-block.
   :feedback_c: Python will also execute the statement that follows the if-block (because it is not enclosed in an else-block, but rather just a normal statement).
   :feedback_d: It is valid to have an if-block without a corresponding else-block (though you cannot have an else-block without a corresponding if-block).

   What does the following code print?

   .. code-block:: python

   x = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
   y = float(input("Enter an integer: "))
if (x < y):
    x = x + 1
    if (x % y == 0):
        x = y
    elif x % y >= 2:
        x = x % y
if (x >= 3):
    y-=1
print("x=" + str(x))
print("y=" + str(y))
