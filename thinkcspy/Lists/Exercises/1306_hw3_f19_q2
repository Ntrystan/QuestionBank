    **[30 points]  Question 2.** Write a function ``capTitle(line)`` that capitalizes the first letter of each word in the line as in a title header of a newspaper. The first word is always capitalized. Special words are not capitalized - such as ‘a’, ‘the’, etc.

    A list ``specialWords`` is in the code below which contains all the special words that are not to be capitalized (unless it is the first word of the title). The function should return a string of the capitalized line.


    Example Titles
        The Story of the Amazing Rat

        A Battle That Will Never Be Forgotten

        In the Beginning of Time

    Example Input & Output
        Enter title: the story of the amazing rat

        (Expected output) The Story of the Amazing Rat

    import string

    # the list of special words - you can use this as a global variable
    # within your function
    specialWords = ['a', 'an', 'the', 'at', 'by', 'for', 'in',
               'of', 'on', 'to', 'up', 'and', 'as',
               'but', 'or', 'nor']

    # define the capTitle() function here



    # DO NOT CHANGE CODE BELOW 
    
    print(capTitle(input("Enter title: ")))
