   Write a function named average to take a string with numbers
   separated by commas and return the average of the numbers.
   Hint: Use the string split method to get the numbers into
   a list - and remember that the numbers in the list will
   still be strings. It might help if you print the list after
   splitting.

   def average(data_str):
       '''Returns the average of numbers in data_str'''
       #Add your code here to split the numbers and average them
       #Use the accumulator pattern to get the total
       #Use len() so you can handle any number of numbers
       #Don't forget to return the result

   
   print(average("10, 20, 30"))
   print(average("10, 20, 30, 40, 50"))
