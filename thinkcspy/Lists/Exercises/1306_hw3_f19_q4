    **[BONUS 20 points]  Question 4.**  Write a function ``countOrange`` that counts the occurrences of the word ``Orange`` (or ``orange``)  as it refers to a fruit. However, the word Orange can mean other things. You can be sure that the fruit is being referenced if at least one of the following words is no more than distance 3 away from an occurrence of ``Orange`` (or ``orange``):  ``[eat, fruit, slice, peel, juice]``
