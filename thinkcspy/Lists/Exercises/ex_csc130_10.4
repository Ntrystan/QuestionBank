   Create a list containing 100 random integers between 
   0 and 1000 (use iteration, append, and the random module).
   Write a function called findmax that will take the list
   as a parameter and return the maximum value in the list.
   Do not use the builtin max() function.
   ~~~~
   import random

   def findmax(numbers):
       '''Returns the maximum in a list of integers'''
       #Add your code her to find the max.
       #Set a variable to 0 -- this will hold the current max
       #For each number in the list
           #If the number is greater than the current max
               #Set the current max to the number
       #Return the maximum number

   #Add your code here to create a list of random integers
   #Start with an empty list
   #Loop 1000 times (Use a for loop)
       #Generate a random number and assign it to a variable
       #Add the number to the end of the list
   #Call findmax, sending it the list of random numbers
   #Print the result
