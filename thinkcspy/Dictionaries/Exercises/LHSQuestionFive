    Every four years, the summer Olympics are held in a different country. Add a
    key-value pair to the dictionary ``places`` that reflects that the 2016 Olympics
    were held in Brazil. Do not rewrite the entire dictionary to do this!
 
    ~~~~   
    places = {"Australia":2000, "Greece":2004, "China":2008, "England":2012}
    
    # your code here to make changes to the places dictionary.
