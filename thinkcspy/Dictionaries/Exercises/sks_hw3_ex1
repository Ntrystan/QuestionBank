    Write a function called ``countALL(text)`` that returns a dictionary with the key as the 
    letter and the value as the number of times each letter appears in a given string.

    Example: ``print(countAll("BaNaNa"))`` will return the dictionary ``{'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}``

    Test your function my calling the function with various example text inputs in the main function.

        # your code here

    def main():
