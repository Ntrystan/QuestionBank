    The dictionary ``golds`` contains information about how many gold medals each
    country won in the 2016 Olympics. But today, Spain won 2 more gold medals.
    Update ``golds`` to reflect this information. Do not hard code this.


    ~~~~   
    golds = {"Italy": 12, "USA": 33, "Brazil": 15, "China": 27, "Spain": 19, "Canada": 22, "Argentina": 8, "England": 29}
    
    # your code here to make changes to the golds dictionary.
