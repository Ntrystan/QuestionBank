   Search on the internet for fractions that approximate the value for **pi**.  Write a program to compute the approximation using a fraction and then print that value, as well as the value of ``math.pi`` from the math module. Your answer should be accurate to at least 3 decimal places compared to the ``math.pi`` value.
