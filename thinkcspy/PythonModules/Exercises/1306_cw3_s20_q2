   **[20 pts] Question 2** 

   The trigonometry book says:	``sin^2(t) + cos^2(t) = 1``
   
   Write a Python program that verifies the formula with the help of the Python Math library. 
   Note that the library trigonometric functions act on the angles in radians. 
   Your program should perform the following steps 3 times: 
   
   i) Pick a random number between 0 and 180 degrees representing an angle in degrees, say ``Dangle``  
   
   ii) Convert the angle from degrees to radians, say ``Rangle`` 
   
   iii)  use the Math library to find and print the values of ``sin(Rangle)`` and ``cos(Rangle)``, and 
   
   iv) compute and print the value of the above expression:  ``sin^2(Rangle) + cos^2(Rangle)``.

   You can then visually verify if the result printed is 1 (or close to it). 
   
   *Hint: angle_in_radians = (angle_in_degrees * Pi)/180*
