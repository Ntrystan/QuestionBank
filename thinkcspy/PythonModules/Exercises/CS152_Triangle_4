    Write a turtle program to draw a right triangle, starting at a random location in the window, and with two random length sides. Do not use the goto function. See the math module for ways of computing the length of the hypotenuse. You will also have to calculate the exact angle to turn. You may use trig functions or look at turtle functions position and toward.
