   :answer_a: the first variable name in the module
   :answer_b: a comment early in the module
   :answer_c: it's called whatever we name it in the "import" statement
   :answer_d: the filename of the module
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: This does not determine module name, and not all modules export variables.
   :feedback_b: This does not determine module name, and comments are not mandatory components of modules.
   :feedback_c: The import statement uses the module name to lookup the correct module, and an import statement is not used to create the module.
   :feedback_d: The filename of the module determines the name of the import.

   What determines the name of our import?
