   **[Bonus 20 points] Question 4**. The marketing department wants to make your company's annual report more upbeat!
   You have agreed to help them by replacing all occurrences of "good" in the report to "fantastic", and all occurrences of "poor" to "average". 
   
   Your task is to write a Python function ``lightup(report)``  that takes the report as a string argument and returns the enhanced report as a string.
   You must then print the enhanced report outside the function. 

   If user response is ``report = Astros are good and Yankees are poor``, the above program should print: 
   
   ::

      Astros are fantastic and Yankees are average
