    **(10 pts)** Create a function ``hello(first, last, flavor)`` that **returns** a single string as follows:

    ``hello('Steph', 'Curry', 'strawberry')`` returns the string:

    ``Hello, my name is Steph Curry. I like strawberry ice cream.`` 

    **NOTE:** There is a single space between each word.
