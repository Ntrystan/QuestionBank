   :feedback_a: Yes, 6 bits can represent 64 shades of gray
   :feedback_b: No, you only need 5 bits to represent 32 shades of gray
   :feedback_c: No, you can represent quite a few more than 6 shades of gray
   :feedback_d: No, you can represent more than 31 shades of gray with 6 bits

   Imagine that you are developing a gray-scale image processing program that
   uses 6 bits to represent each pixel. How many shades of gray can each pixel
   take on?
