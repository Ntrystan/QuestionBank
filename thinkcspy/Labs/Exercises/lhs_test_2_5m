    **(6 pts)** Create a function ``idNumber2(idString)`` which returns 
    an interger of the id number in the ID string.

    The ID string has the format ``??...???-###...###-???...???`` where ? 
    can be any alphabetic-numeric character and # can be any number from 0 to 9. 

    The ID string will always be “legal” according to these rules:

    * There is at least one alpha-numeric character at the beginning. 

    * There is a always a ``-`` before and after the ID number

    * There is at least 1 # in the id number sequence. 

    * There is at least one alpha-mumeric character at the end of the ID string. 

    Examples:

    ``idNumber2('LHS-123-F4')`` returns ``123``
