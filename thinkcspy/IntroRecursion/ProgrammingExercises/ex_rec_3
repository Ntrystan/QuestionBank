   Modify the recursive tree program using one or all of the following
   ideas:

   -  Modify the thickness of the branches so that as the ``branchLen``
      gets smaller, the line gets thinner.

   -  Modify the color of the branches so that as the ``branchLen`` gets
      very short it is colored like a leaf.

   -  Modify the angle used in turning the turtle so that at each branch
      point the angle is selected at random in some range. For example
      choose the angle between 15 and 45 degrees. Play around to see
      what looks good.

   -  Modify the ``branchLen`` recursively so that instead of always
      subtracting the same amount you subtract a random amount in some
      range.

   If you implement all of the above ideas you will have a very
   realistic looking tree.
