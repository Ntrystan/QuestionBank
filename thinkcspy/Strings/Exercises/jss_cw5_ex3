    This problem is about finding commonality between two strings.

    a.	Write a function ``CommonLetters(mystring)`` that returns the number of letters in ``mystring`` that also occur in the string 'Python'.
    b.	Using above function, write a program that repeatedly prompts the user for a string and then prints the number of letters in the string that are also in string 'Python'. The program terminates when the user types an empty string.
