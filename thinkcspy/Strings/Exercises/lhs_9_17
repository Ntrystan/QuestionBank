    Write a function ``printComment(lineOfCode)`` that takes the input string which
    is one line of code and returns a string which is the ``lineOfCode`` from the 
    first ``#`` to the end of the line.

    As practice, do not use any string method

    ``printComment("def f(x):  # this is a function")`` returns ``# this is a function``

    def printComment(lineOfCode):
        # write your code here
    
    # any test cases you'd like to have
