    Write a python program to that will find the longest word in a given sentence.  
    Your program should request the user to enter a sentence.  The sentence should be 
    broken into a list of words using the space between words as a delimiter.  The program 
    should include a function ``findLongest(wordlist)`` that takes the list of words as the argument 
    and returns the first longest word in the sentence.
