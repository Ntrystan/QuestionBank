    Write a function ``removeRepeated(s)`` which takes the string ``str`` and 
    returns a string where all consecutive repeated letters are removed.

    ``removeRepeated('thiiiiis issss a test')`` returns ``this is a test``

    ``removeRepeated('thiis isss a     ttttttest')`` returns ``this is a test``

    ~~~~
    def removeRepeated(s):
        # write your code here
    
    # any test cases you'd like to have
    removeRepeated('thiiiiis issss a test')   # this is a test
    removeRepeated('thiis isss a     ttttttest')  # this is a test
