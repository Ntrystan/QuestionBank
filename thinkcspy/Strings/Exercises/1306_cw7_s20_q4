    **Question 4 [PRACTICE]** 

    *Note: This is a practice problem, it will not be graded.*

    The marketing department wants to make your companyâ€™s annual report more upbeat! You have agreed to help them \
    by replacing all occurrences of ``good`` in the report to ``fantastic``, and all occurrences of ``poor`` to ``average``. \
    Your task is to write a Python function lightup(report) that takes the report as a string argument and returns \
    the enhanced report as a string. You must then print the enhanced report outside the function.

    If user response is report = **Astros are good and Yankees are poor**, the above program should print: 

    ::
 
        Astros are fantastic and Yankees are average
