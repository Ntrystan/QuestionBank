    Write a program that creates the variables 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Set all the 
    variables to the same value. Print out the values of all the variables. Then 
    make 'b' equal to the sum of 'a' and 'c'. Make 'c' equal to the product of 
    'a' and 'b'. Finally, print out the values of all the variables. Your output 
    should look like this:
 
         	a = 4

         	b = 4

         	c = 4

 
         	a = 4

         	b = 8

         	c = 32
