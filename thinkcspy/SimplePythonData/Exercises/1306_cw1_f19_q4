   [30 pts] The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning
   compound interest is given as:

   ``A = P (1 + r / n)^(nt)``

   where,

   `P = principal amount (initial investment`

   `r = annual nominal interest rate (as a decimal)`

   `n = number of times the interest is compounded per year`

   `t = number of years`

   Write a Python program that assigns the principal amount of 8000 to
   variable `P`, assign to `n` the value 15, and assign to `r` the interest
   rate of 6% (0.06).  Then have the program prompt the user for the number of years,
   `t`, that the money will be compounded for.  Calculate and print the final
   amount after `t` years.
