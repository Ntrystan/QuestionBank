   **Homework 4**

   Write a program that converts US $ Dollars to Euros. Your program should ask the user how many dollars they would like to convert. The user then enters a dollar-and-cents amount X and the program responds  "$X converts to Y Euros." You will need to look up the currency conversion rate on the web and use that number in your program. Runestone Interactive does not support the command::

   `X = eval(input("How many dollars would you like to convert?"))`

   The first two lines written below will convert an input string into a float.
   ~~~~
   x = input("How many dollars would you like to convert?")
   x = float(x)
