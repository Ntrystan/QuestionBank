   [40 pts] Write a Python program that translates a binary number of ``n`` bits to a decimal number.  Your program should first ask the user 
   the length of the binary number (how many bits).  Using that information, ask the user to provide each bit from lowest to highest.  
   Once the user has entered all the bit values for the binary number, report back the decimal value.

   Make sure to add comments to your program. Write as comments the expected output of one run of your program indicating a choice of number as user input. 

   Your program should not use any functions or methods we have not discussed in class.

   Example:
   ::

     How many bits in your binary number?: 4
     Please enter the bit value from lowest to highest: 1
     Please enter the bit value from lowest to highest: 0
     Please enter the bit value from lowest to highest: 0
     Please enter the bit value from lowest to highest: 1

     Number in decimal value is: 9
