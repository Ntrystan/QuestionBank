   [25 pts] Consider the below program:

   a)	What would you replace the dummy comment line with, so that it reflects what the program is doing?

   b)	The program has a syntax error. Can you identify it? What line number does it occur on? Please indicate that by inserting a comment above the line(s) and correct the line(s).  

   c)	Once the syntax error is corrected, run the program  for inputs  ``7``, ``3``, ``Peyton``,and  ``Manning``. What is the output? State this as a comment.

   d)	If there is still an error (runtime or logic), explain how you will correct it and indicate the erroneous lines with a comment above them.  Write the corrected versions of any erroneous statement.

   e)	If you made any corrections, what it is the output now for inputs: ``7``, ``3``, ``Peyton``,and  ``Manning``.
