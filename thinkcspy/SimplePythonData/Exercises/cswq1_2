   :feedback_a: Yes, x += 10 is the same as x = x + 10
   :feedback_b: No, x += 10 is the same as x = x + 10
   :feedback_c: No, x += 10 is the same as x = x + 10
   :feedback_d: No, x += 10 is the same as x = x + 10

   What is the value of x after executing the following code?::

      x = 27
      x += 10
