    Write a program that will compute the area of a circle. Prompt the user to enter the radius and print a nice message back to the user with the answer. (change the ``area`` assignment in ``area_of_circle``).

    **Note**: There is only a single line that you need to modify below
    ~~~~
    import math

    def area_of_circle (r):
        # formula for area of a circle is: (math.pi) times (r squared) 
        area = 0 # ---fix this line only---
        return area

    radius = int(input("What is the radius of the circle? "))

    print("Area of a circle with radius ", radius,  " is", area_of_circle (radius))
