   **Homework 6**

   Write a script that asks for two numbers:

   1.  m = max

   2.  c = step size

   where m and c are both positive integers. Your program will print out all of the multiples 0 < x < m+1 as a STRING which prints horizontally. Example run:

   If m = 18 and c = 3, program prints "3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18"

   if m = 18 and c = 4, program prints "4, 8, 12, 16"

   Note that each multiple is followed by a comma + a space   except for the last one. Try to re-create that pattern, it will take some experimenting. If you do not get the commas & spaces right you will still get partial credit. There are many ways to solve this problem, just be sure to test-run your code with random integers.
