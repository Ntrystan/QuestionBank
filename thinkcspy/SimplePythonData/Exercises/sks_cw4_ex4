   [30 pts] Write a program to print the first ``k`` prime numbers.  Your program should 
   request the value of ``k`` from the user and use the given function ``isPrime`` as part of your solution.  
   The given function ''isPrime`` takes as argument an integer and returns ``True`` if that integer is a 
   prime number, else returns ``False``.

   def isPrime(n):
      is_prime = True
      for i in range(2, n):
          if n % i == 0:
              is_prime = False
      return is_prime

   # Write your main program here
