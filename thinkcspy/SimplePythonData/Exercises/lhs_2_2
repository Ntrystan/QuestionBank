    How long (how many characters) is the string in the variable ``sent``? Write code to assign the length of that string to a variable called ``len_of_sent``.

    How long is the string in the variable ``short_sent``? Write code to assign the value of that string's length to a variable ``short_len``.

    Write code to print out the value of ``short_len`` (and the value of len_of_sent, if you want!) so you can see it.

    Consider (ungraded but important): Why is the length of ``short_sent`` longer than 15 characters?

    **HINT**: See 2.6 and look for a function that can return the length of a string.
