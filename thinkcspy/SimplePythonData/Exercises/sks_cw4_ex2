   [30 pts] Write a python function "print_pattern(n,m)" that will take two integer values as parameters, n and m, and will print a pattern of n lines with m ‘*’. 

   For example, a call to the function "print_pattern(3,6)" will generate the following pattern:

   ::

   * * * * * *
   * * * * * *
   * * * * * *

   Hint: To prevent the print function from breaking a line you can specify the last character to be printed to be a white space as follows: print(‘*’, end = “ “)
