   [60 pts] Write a Python program that does the following: 

   The program will provide the user with 5 dishes from a restaurant. The dishes must include 1 appetizer, 3 main dishes, and 1 dessert. 
   The user must type a zero (0) if she/he does not want that dish and a one (1) if she/he does want to have that dish. All dishes have a fixed 
   price that you must decide on.  After reading the choices by the user you should output the total cost of the dishes, the taxes, and the 
   total amount owed by the user. 
   
   Example of how the program would run is shown below.  You can decide on your own menu and prices for each dish for your restaurant.
   
   Make sure to add comments to your program. Write as comments the expected output of one run of your program indicating the user choices. 


   Example:
   ::

     Welcome to Restaurant Yummy Food!

     Type 1/0 if you want or not one of the following dishes:

     Edamame ($2.00): 0

     Alaskan Salmon with garlic ($12.00): 1

     Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes ($8.00): 0

     Meatloaf English Style ($11:00): 1

     Chocolate Chip Cookies ($3.00): 1

     Total Cost of Food Items: $26.00

     Taxes (8%): $2.08

     Total Cost with Taxes: $28.08
