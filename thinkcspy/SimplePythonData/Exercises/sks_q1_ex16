   [30 pts] Recall the mathematical “Factorial” function:
   Factorial(k) = k*(k-1)*(k-2)….*1

   e.g. Factorial (5) = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

   Write a Python program that requests an integer as input and then computes and prints the Factorial of the number. A user session will proceed as follows:
   ::

     The program prints: Enter Integer
     The user enters: 10
     The program prints: Factorial of 10 is 3628800
