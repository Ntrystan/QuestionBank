   [40 pts] Write a Python program that translates a decimal number between 0-15 in binary format. You need to provide all 4 bits when doing the conversion. 

   Make sure to add comments to your program. Write as comments the expected output of one run of your program indicating a choice of number as user input. 

   Solution should only be based on what we have learned in class so far. 

   Example:
   ::

     Enter a decimal number between 0 and 15: 9

     Number in binary format is: 1001
