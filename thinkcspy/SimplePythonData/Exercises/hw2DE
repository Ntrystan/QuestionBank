   **HW 2**

   Write a script that sums up the odd numbers between 40 and 50 and contains the FOR loop

   ``for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:``   

   The numbers 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 should not appear anywhere in your program. The output of your code should read "The sum of the odd numbers between 40 and 50 is XXX". I must be able to change your output by changing the list [1,2,3,4,5]
   ~~~~


   for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
