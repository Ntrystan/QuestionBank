   **Q3a [15 pts]** Write a Python program that will compute the mpg for a car over a trip. The program will nicely ask for the distance driven in miles and the gallons of gas used, and print a message with the mpg for the car.
   
   *[Hint: Write expressions for miles per gallon and miles per dollar in terms of input variables before you start writing your program. Include this as a comment in your program. Break the problem into sub-computations]*
