   :feedback_a: Yes, this is a common pattern - averaging a list of numbers
   :feedback_b: No, notice that total holds the sum of the numbers in the list and it's divided by the number of items in the list
   :feedback_c: No, notice that total holds the sum of the numbers in the list and it's divided by the number of items in the list
   :feedback_d: Notice that total holds the sum of the numbers in the list and it's divided by the number of items in the list - you should be able to figure out what the result is
