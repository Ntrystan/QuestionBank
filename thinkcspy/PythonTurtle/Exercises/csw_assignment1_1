   Draw five circles with a radius of 20 in a turtle window:
   draw a red circle at -100, -100, a green circle at 100, 100,
   a blue circle at -100, 100, an orange circle at 100, -100, and
   a purple circle at 0, 0. There should be no lines between the
   circles. You are not expected to use any loops for this program,
   although you may use one or more loops if you want to.
