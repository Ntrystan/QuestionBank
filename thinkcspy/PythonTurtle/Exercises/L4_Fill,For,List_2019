    Create a window or screen named 'wn'

    Create a turtle named 'Jamal'.  Set a color, a pensize (9 or more), and 
    a shape. 

    Use a for loop to draw a Pentagon, 5 sides, with each side a different 
    color.  

    Use a list to achieve this as in the Lesson for Section 4.6    ["purple", 
    "gold", ....

    Fill in the inside of the Pentagon with another color.  

    Create another shape (the sides can be all the same) 
    and Fill it with a new color.
