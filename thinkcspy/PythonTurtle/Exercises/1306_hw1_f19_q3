   [20 pts] In problem 3 of Classwork-2 you developed a Python program that takes integers ``N`` and ``Start`` as input and computes the arithmetic average of numbers ``[Start, Start+1, Start+2…Start+N-1]`` and prints the result.
   
   
   Extend this program so that it also prints the harmonic mean of the same numbers. 
   Recall Harmonic mean ``Mh`` of ``[ k1,k2,k3,….kn]`` is defined as follows: 
   
   
   ``Mh  =  n/(1/k1 + 1/k2 +1/k3+…1/kn)``

   `Hints:`
 
   `Must use for loops and range function to solve this question`
