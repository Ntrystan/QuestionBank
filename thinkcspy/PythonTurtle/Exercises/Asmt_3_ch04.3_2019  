    Write a program that will create a turtle and make an equilateral 
    triangle. 
  
    INPUT a background color and a turtle color from the user.  Choose a 
    pen size.  

    After this portion of the program works, create a second turtle.  Input a 
    turtle color.  

    Use the second turtle to create another equilateral triangle, of a 
    different size, somewhere else in the window.
