   38. Dynamic programming is often used to find the best alignment between two strings and is used extensively to find similar sequences of DNA. When the two DNA sequences are roughly the same length, the computational complexity is given as O(N**2). If it takes 30 milliseconds to align 2 DNA sequences, each of length 500, how long will it take, on the same computer, using dynamic programming, to align 2 patterns of length 1500?
