   10. GIF is a popular image format that compresses images by using a color map. The color map has representative 24 bit colors in it - for example, color 0 might be black (0, 0, 0), while color 15 might be a dark gray (25, 25, 25), and color 50 might be a shade of yellow (255, 255, 0). Each pixel, then, is a number that points to a color in the color map. If the pixels are 8 bits each, then how many colors can be in the color map?
