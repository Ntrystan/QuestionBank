    Write 5 print statements so that your name appears on the middle row inside a box. 
    Review the code for the previous exercise. Make sure the box fits snugly around your 
    name - you may have to make the box wider or narrower than it was in the previous exercise. 
    For example::

      +------+
      |      |
      | John |
      |      |
      +------+
