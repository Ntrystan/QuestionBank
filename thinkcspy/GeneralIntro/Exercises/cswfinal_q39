   39. If it takes 3 ms to draw a border around an image, how long
will it take to draw a border around an image twice as big? Hint:
Imagine that the border is one line across the top, one across the bottom, one down the left side and one down the right side. Consider how many pixels you have to change for a 10 x 10 pixel image, how many for a 20 x 20 image, how many for a 30 x 30 pixel image, and so forth. Remember, you're not changing the interior pixels--just the ones around the perimeter.
