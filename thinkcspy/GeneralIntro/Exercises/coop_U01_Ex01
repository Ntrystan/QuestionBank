    The Python print() command is pretty versatile. Experiment with printing various things to see the output. Use this list, creating a new print() statement each time. Your final program should be a bunch of print() statements. Pay attention to the inputs and outputs, and draw conclusions from your observations. Include your observations and conclusions within the code as a multi-line comment. Space has been provided.
