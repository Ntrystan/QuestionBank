   :answer_a: A solution to a problem that can be solved by a computer.
   :answer_b: A step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.
   :answer_c: A block of commands entered in a specific programming language.
   :answer_d: A special kind of notation used by computer scientists.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: While it is true that algorithms often do solve problems, this is not the best answer.  An algorithm is more than just the solution to the problem for a computer.  An algorithm can be used to solve all sorts of problems, including those that have nothing to do with computers.
   :feedback_b: Algorithms are like recipes:  they must be followed exactly, they must be clear and unambiguous, and they must end.
   :feedback_c: Programming languages are used to express algorithms, but an algorithm does not have to be expressed in terms of a programming language.
   :feedback_d: Computer scientists sometimes use a special notation to illustrate or document an algorithm, but this is not the definition of an algorithm.

   An algorithm is:
