   :answer_a: Returns True if the turtle is still on the screen and False if the turtle is no longer on the screen.
   :answer_b: Uses a while loop to move the turtle randomly until it goes off the screen.
   :answer_c: Turns the turtle right or left at random and moves the turtle forward 50.
   :answer_d: Calculates and returns the position of the turtle in the window.
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The isInScreen function computes the boolean test of whether the turtle is still in the window.  It makes the condition of the while loop in the main part of the code simpler.
   :feedback_b: The isInScreen function does not contain a while-loop.  That loop is outside the isInScreen function.
   :feedback_c: The isInScreen function does not move the turtle.
   :feedback_d: While the isInScreen function does use the size of the window and position of the turtle, it does not return the turtle position.

   In the random walk program in this section, what does the isInScreen function do?
