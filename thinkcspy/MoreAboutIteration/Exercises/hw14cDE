   **Homework 14 part c**
  
    Write a program to determine how many consecutive integers greater than 9 must be added together to create a sum greater than 10,000. In other words,  

     10 + 11 + 12 + 13 +...+ N-2 + N-1 + N > 10,0000

    Your code should return two pieces of information in printed format:

     1. print("The value of N is", N)
     2. print("The *number of elements* in the set {10,11,12,13...N-2, N-1, N} is", X)

    If you choose to write your hw solution as a function ``def main()``, remember to invoke the function ``main()`` at the bottom of your page in order to run the function!
