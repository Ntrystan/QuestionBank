    Write a Python function ``FindPrimes2(Q)`` that takes a parameter ``Q`` as argument and 
    returns the Qth prime number. Test for Q = 100  

    In solving this problem, use the ``isPrime(number)`` function you already wrote in the 
    previous question.  
    Hint: Use while loop in writing the function ``FindPrimes2(Q)``.
