   **Homework 13 - Guessing game**

    Modify the code you wrote for Bingo! as follows. 

    First the program will generate a random number from 1 to 50 using the random() module. Don’t tell the user what the random number is!

    Next you will call the function enter(). For each guess there are three possible responses::


     “Too high” followed by “Guess?” from the enter() function

     “Too low” followed by “Guess?” from the enter() function

     “Bingo!”` at which point it exits the program

    
    However, instead of limiting the user to 5 guesses as you did in Bingo! this program lets the user take as many guesses as they like. Try using a ``while`` loop to allow unlimited guessing.
