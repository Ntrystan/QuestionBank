   10. Imagine that you have a video with dimensions 400 x 600 pixels. A video, as you may know, is just a sequence of images - 30 images/second for television; 24 images/second for movies. Assume you are shooting a greenscreen scene for a movie; the green background will be replaced by an image of an exotic locale. How many pixels will your system process for each second of video?
