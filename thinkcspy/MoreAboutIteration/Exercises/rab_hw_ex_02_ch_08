   Write a program that includes a function called ``find_zero(a, b, tol)`` that uses the bisection method to locate a value ``x*`` for which the function ``f(x)`` has zero (i.e. ``f(x*) = 0``). Use a ``while`` loop within your function to iterate the process until a prescribed tolerance is achieved. The parameters ``a`` and ``b`` define an interval on the ``x`` axis on which the function ``f(x)`` has at least one zero. The parameter ``tol`` specifies the tolerance to be achieved. The ``find_zero(a, b, tol)`` function returns the approximation ``x*`` and the number of iterations required that are printed out in the ``main()`` function. Use 0.001 as an initial tolerance. Your program will include a function ``f(x)`` as well as a ``main()`` function. Use f(x) = x**2 - 17
