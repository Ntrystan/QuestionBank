   You are tasked to write a function called ``findMax(aList)`` that iterates through a list and returns the maximum value.

   Ensure that the code is in the correct order.
   -----
   def findMax(aList):
   =====
      if len(aList) == 0:
         return None
   =====
      currentMax = aList[0]
   =====
      for item in aList:
   =====
      for item in currentMax:   #distractor  
   =====
         if item &gt; currentMax:
   =====
            currentMax = item
   =====
            currentMax = currentMax + 1 #distractor
   =====
      return currentMax
