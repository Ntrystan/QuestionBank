    #Smith JA CDT A-1 '16. 2017 Sept 15. Assistance given to the author,
    #verbal discussion.  CDT Smith and I discussed how to do the homework and helped
    #each other understand the different parts we had to complete.  We each typed our
    #own version of the assignment but we worked together to get all of it completed.
