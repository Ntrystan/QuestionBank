    #Smith JA CDT A-1 '16. 2018 Jan 3. Assistance given to the author,
    #verbal discussion.  After class, CDT Smith and I discussed the best
    #way to draw a circle in the bullsEye program. He decided to create
    #a function that would draw a circle by first taking a center point's coordinates as input.
    #I agreed and created my own function called drawCircle that took the
    #center coordinate as input in my own program. West Point, NY.
