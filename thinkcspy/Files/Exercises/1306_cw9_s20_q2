    **Question 2 [50 points]** 
     
    Write a program that reads a file named 'studentdata.txt' that contains the names of students in a section of COSC 1306 along with their exam scores separated by spaces. The first four entries in the file contain scores out of 100 points each as follows:``[classwork homework midterm final-exam]``. Any additional entries can be ignored.  Your program should print each student's cumulative score. The classwork is 10%, homework is 40%, midterm is 20%, and the final exam is 30% of the cumulative score

    Example of data in the file 'studentdata.txt':

    ::

        joe 10 15 20 30 40
        bill 23 16 19 22
        sue 8 22 17 14 32 17 24 21 2 9 11 17
        grace 12 28 21 45 26 10
        john 14 32 25 16 89

    Your program output should look like the example below for the given file (studentdata.txt):

    ::

        joe has a cumulative score of 20.00
        bill has a cumulative score of 19.10
        sue has a cumulative score of 17.20
        grace has a cumulative score of 30.10
        john has a cumulative score of 24.00
