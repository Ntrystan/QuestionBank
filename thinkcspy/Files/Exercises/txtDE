   **t.txt and v.txt**

   Download the files 't.txt' and 'v.txt' (both posted on wamap) into the same folder on your computer, then use the IDLE editor to write a program (saved in the same folder) that reads both t.txt and v.txt. Print both files to the screen. Then, use the same methods of string manipulation we covered in class to make a printout that looks like this::

     t0, v0
     t1, v1
     t2, v2
     t3, v3
     t4, v4
     etc...

   where the values of t0=0, v0=15, t1=1, v1=17, etc. When you are done writing your code and de-bugging, copy and paste it here:
