    **Question 1A [25 points]** 
     
    The following refer to a file similar to "qbdata.txt" in section 11.3 of the Runestone book. You need to write the following functions:

    **QBSearch(filehandle, searchterm)** that takes a file handle and a string searchterm as parameters and returns a list of QB firstnames in the corresponding file, where the last name or part of the lastname matches searchterm.

    ::

        QBSearch(filehandle, ‘Manning’) would return [‘Payton’, ‘Eli’]
        QBSearch(filehandle, ‘McCoy) would return [‘Colt’]
        QBSearch(filehandle, ‘Patton’) woud return []
        QBSearch(filehandle, ‘an’) would return ['Josh', 'Peyton', 'Matt', 'Mark', 'Eli']

    You can test the program by reading the file in your main program and calling these functions.
