  In the equation to calculate the fragment's color,
  :code:`gl_FragColor = vec4(vec3(v_Color) * cos_angle, v_Color.a);`
  why are the casting of vectors required? (Select all that apply.)

  - The value assigned to :code:`gl_FragColor` is required to be a 4 component vectors that
    contains :code:`(red, green, blue, alpha)` values.

    + Correct.

  - The diffuse light calculations affect the color of the fragment, but not it's transparency.

    + Correct.

  - Casting is always required when assigning a value to a variable.

    - Incorrect. NO!!!

  - Scaling a vector always requires a cast.

    - Incorrect. Any vector can be scaled without a cast, with the result
      being a new vector of the same size as the original.
