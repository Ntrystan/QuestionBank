  What is *lambert’s cosine law*?

  - The intensify of diffuse light reflection is proportional to the cosine of the angle between
    the surface's normal vector and a light ray.

    + Correct.

  - The cosine of an angle is always between -1.0 and 1.0.

    - Incorrect. The fact is true, but it is not *lambert’s cosine law*.

  - *Lambert’s cosine law* says that diffuse light reflection is calculated by a dot product.

    - Incorrect.

  - *Lambert’s cosine law* says that light bends around objects to illuminate all objects in a scene.

    - Incorrect.
