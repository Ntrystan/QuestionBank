  What is a "light model"?

  - A set of data and algorithms that simulates a light source and how it interacts with objects in a scene.

    + Correct.

  - A geometric representation of a lamp.

    - Incorrect. You might create such an object for a scene, but lighting models are only concerned with the light from its bulb.

  - A model that does not weigh much.

    - Incorrect. That's silly!

  - An equation that explains light ray reflections from a surface.

    - Incorrect. But this might be a part of a light model.
