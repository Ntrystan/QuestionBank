  Does a *spotlight* light source perform diffuse and specular lighting calculations?

  - Yes, but only if the cone of light strikes the surface.

    + Correct. The calculations are identical to a *point* light source, but only if
      the fragment receives light from the *spotlight*.

  - No, it only does *spotlight* calculations.

    - Incorrect.

  - Yes, for all fragments in the scene.

    - Incorrect. The calculations are identical to a *point* light source, but only if
      the fragment receives light from the *spotlight*.

  - Sometimes, if the fragment is close to the *spotlight*.

    - Incorrect. The distance to the *spotlight* is not the issue. The issue is
      whether any light from the *spotlight* strikes the fragment.
