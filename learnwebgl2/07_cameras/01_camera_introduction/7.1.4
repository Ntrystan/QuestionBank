  :answer_a: The eye and center point are at the same location.
  :answer_b: The up vector is parallel to the line-of-sight vector.
  :answer_c: The eye is at the origin.
  :answer_d: The up vector is parallel with the Z axis.
  :correct: a,b
  :feedback_a: Correct. If the eye and center point are the same, the line-of-sight vector they are meant to define can't be calculated.
  :feedback_b: Correct. If the up vector and the line-of-sight vector have the same direction, their cross-product will calculate an invalid vector.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The eye location can be anywhere, as long as the eye and center locations define a valid line-of-sight vector.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. The up vector can be in any direction, as long as it is not the same as the line-of-sight.

  Which of the following will define an invalid camera? (Select all that apply.)
