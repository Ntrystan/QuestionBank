  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The camera would move to its right, which is along the <0,0,1> axis, so you add 2 units to the z coordinate.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. You need to move along the camera's "to the right" axis.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. You need to move along the camera's "to the right" axis.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. You need to move along the camera's "to the right" axis.

  You have a camera that is located at :code:`(3, 4, 5)` and whose orientation is
  defined by the vectors: :code:`u = <0,0,1>`, :code:`v = <0,1,0>`, and :code:`n = <1,0,0>`.
  (The camera is looking down a vector parallel to the -X axis.) If you "truck right"
  two units, what would be the location of the camera?
