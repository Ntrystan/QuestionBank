  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The last column contains the location.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This is a vector that indicates the "to the right" local coordinate axis of the model.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This is a vector that indicates the "up" local coordinate axis of the model.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. This is a vector that indicates the "back" local coordinate axis of the model.

  Given the following model transformation matrix, where will the model be located
  in the scene after using this transform?
