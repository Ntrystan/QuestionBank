  :answer_a: The upper left 3x3 sub-matrix must define 3 vectors that are orthogonal to each other.
  :answer_b: Nothing. Given any 4x4 matrix, its transpose is always equal to its inverse.
  :answer_c: The matrix has to contain translation, scaling, and rotation.
  :answer_d: The values along the diagonal have to all be 1.0.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Given any 4x4 matrix, its transpose is typically NOT equal to its inverse.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. In fact, the transformation can't contain translation and scaling.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect.

  Given a 4x4 transformation matrix, what must be true about the matrix
  for its inverse to be equal to its transpose?
