  :answer_a: sine and cosine are only defined in a plane, but a tilt is relative to a camera's current orientation.
  :answer_b: well, actually you could use normal trig calculations.
  :answer_c: sine and cosine only work in the x-y plane.
  :answer_d: matrix transforms minimize the calculations required.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The tilt rotation is about an arbitrary axis, not the x, y or z axis.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Actually, you can't!
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Sine and cosine only work in a plane, but are not restricted to the x-y plane.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Matrix multiplies are computationally expensive.

  A **tilt** camera movement is a rotation. Why can't we use simple trig functions
  like *sine* and *cosine* to calculate the required modifications to the camera definition?
  Why do we have to use matrix transforms?
