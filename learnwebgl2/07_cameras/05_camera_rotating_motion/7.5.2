  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. You are rotating "up" or "down" from the camera's current orientation.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Rotating about the v axis would be a pan motion.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Rotating along the n axis would be a cant motion.

  To perform a **tilt** camera movement, which camera axis must you rotate about?
