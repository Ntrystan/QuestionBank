  If a surface property is the same for all triangles in a polygonal mesh, the
  data used to model the surface property is typically stored in what type of
  *shader program* variable?

  - :code:`uniform`

    + Correct.

  - :code:`attribute`

    - Incorrect. :code:`attribute` variables hold data that is different for each vertex.

  - :code:`varying`

    - Incorrect. :code:`varying` variables hold data that is interpolated between the
      vertices that define a geometric primitive (i.e., point, line, triangle).

  - global constant

    - Not the preferred answer, but technically correct. However, this makes
      the *shader program* more specific and perhaps not usable in other scenes.
      Making the data :code:`uniform` allows a JavaScript program to "tweak"
      rendering parameters at run-time.
