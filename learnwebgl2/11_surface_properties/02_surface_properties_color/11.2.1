  To get the most realistic light modeling possible, the color of a surface should
  be represented by ...

  - one RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) value.

    - Incorrect. This works fine for simple renderings, but not for realistic lighting.

  - two RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) values: one for reflection and one for absorption.

    - Incorrect.

  - three RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) values: one for ambient reflection, one for diffuse reflection, and one specular reflection.

    + Correct.

  - four RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) values: one for red light, one for green light, one for blue light, and one for transparent light.

    - Incorrect. Besides, light can't be transparent.
