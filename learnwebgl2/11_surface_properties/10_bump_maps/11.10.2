  Where are *bump maps* and *normal maps* implemented?

  - both the *vertex shader* and the *fragment shader*

    + Correct. The *vertex shader* retrieves (or calculates) a *local coordinate system* for a triangle;
      The *fragment shader* retrieves (or calculates) a *normal vector* for a fragment.

  - *vertex shader*

    - Incorrect. (But part of the work is done in the *vertex shader*.)

  - *fragment shader*

    - Incorrect. (But part of the work is done in the *fragment shader*.)

  - JavaScript pre-processing code.

    - Incorrect.
