  What does scaling a *texture map* do?

  - It multiplies the *texture coordinates*, :code:`(s,t)`, by a scale factor.

    + Correct.

  - It changes the size of the texture map image.

    - Incorrect. The size of a texture map image is constant.

  - It adds an offset to the location of the *texture coordinates*, :code:`(s,t)`.

    - Incorrect. Addition performs translation, not scaling.

  - It increases or decreases the intensity of the color retrieved from a *texture map* image.

    - Incorrect.
