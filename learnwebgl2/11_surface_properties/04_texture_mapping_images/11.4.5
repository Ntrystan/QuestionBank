  Given an image that is 1024 pixels wide (x-axis) and 256 pixels high (y-axis),
  which pixel in the image is related to the *texture coordinates* :code:`(0.5, 0.5)`?

  - :code:`(128, 512)`

    + Correct. It is half way along the x-axis, and half way along the y-axis.

  - :code:`(1023, 255)`, since the pixels start numbering at zero.

    - Incorrect.

  - :code:`(0, 0)`

    - Incorrect.

  - :code:`(56, 876)`

    - Incorrect.
