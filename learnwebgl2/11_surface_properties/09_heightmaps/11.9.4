  A *heightmap* and a *displacement map* can be implemented with the same
  *vertex shader* program if what is true?

  - The *normal vectors* of the underlying mesh always point in the
    direction of displacement.

    + Correct. For a flat plane, the *normal vectors* will be pointing straight up from the surface.

  - The underlying mesh is always planar.

    - Incorrect. *Displacement maps* are defined for any surface, planar or not.

  - The underlying mesh contains a sufficient number of vertices.

    - Incorrect. The number of vertices determines the fine-grain accuracy of the
      displacements, but not the code implementation.

  - The image used for the mapping is used for both height displacement and the surface's color.

    - Incorrect. The examples above used the same image for both displacement and color,
      but only for the purpose of simplifying the examples.
