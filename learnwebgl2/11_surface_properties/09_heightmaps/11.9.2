  Which of the following modifications to a model's vertices would produce
  a traditional *heightmap*?

  - :code:`vec3 new_vertex = vec3(a_Vertex[0], height, a_Vertex[2]);`

    + Correct. The y-axis component is changed.

  - :code:`vec3 new_vertex = vec3(a_Vertex[0], a_Vertex[1], height);`

    - Incorrect. The z-axis component is not changed.

  - :code:`vec3 new_vertex = vec3(height, a_Vertex[1], a_Vertex[2]);`

    - Incorrect. The x-axis component is not changed.

  - :code:`vec3 new_vertex = a_Vertex + height;`

    - Incorrect. This changes all three components of a vertex.
