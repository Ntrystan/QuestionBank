  :answer_a: prepares the data for clipping.
  :answer_b: normalizes the data for viewport mapping.
  :answer_c: performs clipping.
  :answer_d: projects an image onto a screen.
  :correct: a,b
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Correct.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The projection transformation does not perform clipping. It simply gets the data ready for clipping.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. A physical "projector" shines an image onto a screen, but a projection transformation manipulates vertices.

  A projection transformation "projects" a 3D world onto a 2D image **AND** performs which
  of the following other tasks? (Select all that apply.)
