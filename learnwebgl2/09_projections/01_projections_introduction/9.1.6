  Which of the following matrix multiplications is the correct order for creating a
  single transformation matrix that can be used for a vertex shader?

  - .. matrixeq:: Eq2
      :nolabel:

      VertexTransform = [M1: ProjectionMatrix]*[M2: ViewMatrix]*[M3: ModelMatrix]

    + Correct. The projection must be the last operation performed on the vertices.

  - .. matrixeq:: Eq3
      :nolabel:

      VertexTransform = [M2: ViewMatrix]*[M1: ProjectionMatrix]*[M3: ModelMatrix]

    - Incorrect. The camera must be applied to the scene before the projection.

  - .. matrixeq:: Eq4
      :nolabel:

      VertexTransform = [M3: ModelMatrix]*[M2: ViewMatrix]*[M1: ProjectionMatrix]

    - Incorrect. This makes the projection transformation the first operation when it must be the last.

  - .. matrixeq:: Eq4
      :nolabel:

      VertexTransform = [M2: ViewMatrix]*[M3: ModelMatrix]*[M1: ProjectionMatrix]

    - Incorrect. This makes the camera transformation the last operation, which is wrong.
