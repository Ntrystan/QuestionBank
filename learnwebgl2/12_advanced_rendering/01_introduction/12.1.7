  To have a specific color for the background of a rendering, ...

  - Set the color using :code:`gl.clearColor(red,green,blue,alpha)` and
    call :code:`gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)` at the beginning of each rendering.

    + Correct.

  - Set the color using :code:`gl.clearColor(red,green,blue,alpha)`. (Double
    buffering automatically clears the *color buffer* after it has
    been copied to the *onscreen* buffer.)

    - Incorrect. Double buffering does automatically clear the *color buffer* but
      it is set to the web page's background color, not the color set by :code:`gl.clearColor`.

  - Call :code:`gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)` at the beginning of each rendering.

    - Incorrect. This does clear the *color buffer*, but it uses a default color
      that is probably not the specific color desired.

  - Set the color using :code:`gl.clearColor(red,green,blue,alpha)`.

    - Incorrect. This sets the desired background color, but it does not change any
      color values in the *color buffer*.
