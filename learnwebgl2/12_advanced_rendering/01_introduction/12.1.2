  Which of the following statements are true concerning WebGL extensions? (Select all that apply.)

  - A WebGL extension adds functionality that was not defined in the original WebGL 1.0 specification.

    + Correct.

  - A WebGL extension can only be used if it is supported by the current browser and
    if it is "activated".

    + Correct. :code:`gl.getExtension(name)` activates an extension.

  - A WebGL extension can be used in all browsers that support WebGL 1.0.

    - Incorrect. A browser may (or may not) support specific extensions.

  - Using a WebGL extension makes your WebGL programs executable by a wider audience.

    - Incorrect. It makes a WebGL program less accessible because there
      are possibly browsers that can't execute it because they have not implemented
      the required extension.
