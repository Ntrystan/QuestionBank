  Which of the following is true concerning *double buffering*? (Select all that apply.)

  - The incremental changes to a *color buffer* are never visible to a user.

    + Correct. The *offscreen* buffer is never copied to the *onscreen* buffer until a rendering
      is finished.

  - A rendering process that draws graphic primitives using :code:`gl.drawArrays()` can never
    directly change the *onscreen* buffers.

    + Correct. Rendering always changes the default *rendering target* which is the *offscreen* buffers.

  - Double buffering is automatically set up and enabled by WebGL.

    + Correct. No commands are required to enable double buffering and no commands are required
      to switch buffers after rendering.

  - Double buffering is an excellent feature but it slows down rendering.

    - Incorrect. Double buffering has no impact on rendering speed.
