  How do you guarantee that a rendering pass does not modify the *stencil buffer*?

  - :code:`gl.stencilMask(0x00)`

    + Correct.

  - :code:`gl.stencilMask(0xFF)`

    - Incorrect. This makes every bit in the stencil buffer changeable.

  - :code:`gl.stencilMask(0x01)`

    - Incorrect. This allows the low-order bit of every *stencil buffer* element to be changed.

  - :code:`gl.stencilMask(0xF0)`

    - Incorrect. This allows any of the four high-order bits of every *stencil buffer* element to be changed.
