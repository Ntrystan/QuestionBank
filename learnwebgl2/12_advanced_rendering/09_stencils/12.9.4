  How many rendering passes does it typically take to use a *stencil buffer*
  to control which *color buffer* pixels can be modified?

  - two

    + Correct. One rendering pass to set the *stencil buffer* values, and
      a second rendering pass to use the *stencil buffer* to control writing
      to the *color buffer*.

  - one

    - Incorrect.

  - none

    - Incorrect.

  - four

    - Incorrect. Certainly four passes might be used, but that is not typical.
