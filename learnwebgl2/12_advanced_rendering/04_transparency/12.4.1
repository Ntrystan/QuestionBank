  Transparency is accomplished by combining the color that is currently in the
  *color buffer* with a color from the surface that light passes through using this
  equation:

  .. Code-Block:: C

    color_buffer[x][y].rgb = color.rgb * color.a
                           + color_buffer[x][y].rgb * (1.0 - color.a);

  If :code:`color` is equal to :code:`(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6)` and the :code:`color_buffer[x][y]`
  is equal to :code:`(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0)`, what is the new value of
  the *color buffer*, i.e., :code:`color_buffer[x][y].rgb`?

  - (0.6, 0.4, 0.0)

    + Correct. :code:`(1.0*0.6, 0.0*0.6, 0.0*0.6) + (0.0*0.4, 1.0*0.4, 0.0*0.4)`

  - (0.4, 0.6, 0.0)

    - Incorrect.

  - (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)

    - Incorrect.

  - (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)

    - Incorrect.
