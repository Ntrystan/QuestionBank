  When a color is read from a WebGL *color buffer*, what type of data is returned?

  - Four unsigned bytes in the range 0 to 255.

    + Correct.

  - Four floating point values in the range 0.0 to 1.0.

    - Incorrect. This is how colors are specified in a *fragment shader*,
      but not how they are actually stored in the *color buffer*.

  - One unsigned integer in the range 0 to 2\ :sup:`32`\ -1

    - Incorrect.

  - Three floating point values, RGB, in the range 0.0 to "max_color".

    - Incorrect.
