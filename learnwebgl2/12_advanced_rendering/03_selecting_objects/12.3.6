  Why are two separate *shader programs* needed to accomplish a selection? (Select all that apply.)

  - The *shader program* that puts a unique identifier into the *color buffer* must not perform
    lighting calculations because the lighting calculations would change the ID.

    + Correct.

  - The *shader program* that creates the visible rendering should create a realistic scene.

    + Correct.

  - The *shader program* that puts a unique identifier into the *color buffer* must ignore the
    color properties of the model.

    + Correct.

  - The *shader program* that puts a unique identifier into the *color buffer* must deal
    with light attenuation.

    - Incorrect.
