  Which of the following settings for blending produces the same results as having blending disabled?

  - :code:`gl.blendFunc(gl.ONE, gl.ZERO)`

    + Correct. All of the source's color is used, while none of the destination's color is used.

  - :code:`gl.blendFunc(gl.ZERO, gl.ONE)`

    - Incorrect. This would leave the background color unchanged because the source color would never
      be used.

  - :code:`gl.blendFunc(gl.SRC_ALPHA, gl.DST_ALPHA)`

    - Incorrect.

  - :code:`gl.blendFunc(gl.SRC_COLOR, gl.DST_COLOR)`

    - Incorrect.
