  Given the following options, which is simplest for a *fragment shader* to calculate?

  - Map an entire *texture map* to a point's square.

    + Correct. The *fragment shader* is a single line of code.

  - Map a small sub-area of a *texture map* to a point's square.

    - Incorrect. Calculations must be performed to get offsets to adjacent pixels.

  - Render a point as a circle and *texture map* it.

    - Incorrect. Requires at least two lines of *fragment shader* code.

  - Render a point as a "bulls eye".

    - Incorrect. Requires multiple lines of *fragment shader* code.
