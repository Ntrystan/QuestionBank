  Distance values retrieved from a *shadow map* must be used with a "tolerance" value
  to compensate for losses in precision. Which type of projection has a fairly consistent
  error over the entire range of distance values?

  - Orthographic

    + Correct. Because the mapping of z values to the *depth buffer* is linear.

  - Perspective

    - Incorrect. Because the mapping of z values to the *depth buffer* is non-linear.
