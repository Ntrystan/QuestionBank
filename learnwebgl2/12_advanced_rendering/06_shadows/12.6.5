  Setting up a "camera" to create a *shadow map* for a *point light source* is problematic
  because a camera has a line-of-sight, whereas a point light source shines light in all
  directions. This lesson suggests a strategy for creating a "light source camera".
  Using this strategy, which of the following are shared between a "scene camera"
  and a "light source camera". (Select all that apply.)

  - "Scene camera"'s center location.

    + Correct.

  - "Scene camera"'s up vector.

    + Correct.

  - "Scene camera"'s eye location.

    - Incorrect.
