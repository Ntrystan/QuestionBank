  The *painter's algorithm* performs "hidden surface removal" by ...

  - rendering graphic primitives in sorted order, with the primitives furthest from
    the camera rendered first and the primitives closest to the camera rendered last.

    + Correct.

  - rendering graphic primitives based on their color values, with the red primitives
    first, the green primitives next, and the blue primitives last.

    - Incorrect. That's silly!

  - rendering graphic primitives in the order a programmer defines them.

    - Incorrect.

  - rendering graphic primitives in sorted order, with the primitives closest to
    the camera rendered first and the primitives furthest from the camera rendered last.

    - Incorrect. This is backwards.
