  What is "z-fighting"?

  - When floating point round-off errors cause the color of two surfaces that
    are in the same location in 3D space to alternate colors and cause random
    color patterns.

    + Correct.

  - When two surfaces have the exact same depth values.

    - Incorrect. The problem is not when the values are the same; it is when the depth values alternate.

  - When two different surfaces assign a different color to a fragment.

    - Incorrect. If a surface assigns a color to a fragment, it overwrites the color that
      was previously assigned.

  - When more than two surfaces have the same color.

    - Incorrect.
