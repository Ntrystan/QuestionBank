  A HTML canvas element has HTML properties of :code:`width` and :code:`height`. It can also have
  CSS properties called :code:`width` and :code:`height`. This can be very confusing
  because the properties control different things! Which
  of the following correctly describes how these properties differ.

  - HTML properties: control the size of the WebGL *draw buffers*. :raw-html:`<br>` :raw-html:`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`
    CSS properties: control the size of the canvas on the web page.

    + Correct.

  - HTML properties: control the size of the canvas on the web page. :raw-html:`<br>` :raw-html:`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`
    CSS properties: control the size of the WebGL *draw buffers*.

    - Incorrect. It's backwards!

  - HTML properties: are totally ignored if the CSS properties are defined. :raw-html:`<br>` :raw-html:`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`
    CSS properties: control the size of the canvas on the web page.

    - Incorrect.

  - HTML properties: control the size of the canvas on the web page. :raw-html:`<br>` :raw-html:`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`
    CSS properties: are totally ignored if the HTML properties are defined.

    - Incorrect.
