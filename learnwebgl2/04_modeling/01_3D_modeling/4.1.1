  :answer_a: For fast rendering, we only describe what is visible to the viewer.
  :answer_b: The surface is the object.
  :answer_c: The surface captures everything there is to know about a 3D object.

  :feedback_a: Correct. If some part of a object will never be rendered, then it is not typically modeled.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. 3D objects are more than just their visible surfaces.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. 3D objects are more than just their visible surfaces.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Modeling is actually precise, tedious, and hard work.

  Why does a 3D model typically only describe the 3D surfaces of an object?
