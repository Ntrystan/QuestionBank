  :answer_a: Because each browser has implemented their DOM differently.
  :answer_b: Because setting the property value of a DOM element can require different code for different browsers.
  :answer_c: Because jQuery's search functionality makes manipulating the DOM easier.
  :answer_d: Because JavaScript requires the use of 3rd party libraries to do anything useful.
  :correct: a,b,c
  :feedback_a: Correct. And we would like our web pages to work the same across all browsers.
  :feedback_b: Correct. Without jQuery, simply setting a property value for an element can be very tricky.
  :feedback_c: Correct. jQuery allows you to find DOM elements easily.
  :feedback_d: Not true. JavaScript is a powerful language and you should avoid 3rd party libraries whenever possible.

  JavaScript contains functions that search and manipulate the DOM of a web page. Why not use those
  instead of using a 3rd party library like jQuery? (Select all that apply.)
