  :answer_a: An anonymous callback function that will be executed after a file has been successfully downloaded from the server.
  :answer_b: A sub-function that is executed immediately.
  :answer_c: A sub-function that is executed asynchronously.
  :answer_d: An anonymous callback function that will be executed on "file events".
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. It does define a sub-function, but it is not executed until something specific happens.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. It does define a sub-function, but asynchronous execution implies random execution, which is not true.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. It does define an anonymous callback function, but there is no such thing as generic "file events."

  In the :code:`getFile` function below, what does :code:`function (data) { storage.push(data); }` define?

  .. Code-block:: JavaScript

    function getFile(file_url, storage) {
      $.get(file_url, function (data) { storage.push(data); });
    }
