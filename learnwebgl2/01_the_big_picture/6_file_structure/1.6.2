    :feedback_c: No, there is no sub-folder called "shaders" from the root folder of the server.
    :feedback_d: No, this goes to the parent folder of the parent folder, which is learnwebgl2, which does not have a sub-folder called shaders

    Assume that you have a web page defined by a file :code:`ex1.html` in the folder :code:`program1` of this file hierarchy.
