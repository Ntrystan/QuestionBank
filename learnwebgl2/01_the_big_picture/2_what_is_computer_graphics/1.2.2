    :answer_a: A rectangular grid of pixels, where each pixel has a specific color.
    :answer_b: A description of the types of objects in a scene (e.g., a boy walking a dog.)
    :answer_c: A set of geometric primitives, such as points, lines, and/or triangles.
    :answer_d: A group of colors.
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: No. This is a *raster image*.
    :feedback_b: No. The computer does not understand such high level descriptions.
    :feedback_c: Yes. A *3D computer graphics* rendering creates a picture from the geometric primitives.
    :feedback_d: No. Color information is important, but insufficient to create a rendering.

    How do you define a scene for a *3D computer graphics* rendering?
