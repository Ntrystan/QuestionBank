    :answer_a: the constructor of an object can perform the one-time pre-processing tasks needed for rendering.
    :answer_b: methods of an object can perform the actions needed at render time.
    :answer_c: it reduces the number of global variables that have to be created.
    :answer_d: WebGL is an object-oriented system.
    :correct: a,b,c
    :feedback_a: Correct, when the constructor creates an object, the pre-processing tasks can be done once.
    :feedback_b: Correct, tasks that must be preformed repeatedly can be performed by an object's methods.
    :feedback_c: Correct, an object encapsulates data and functions that would be global otherwise.
    :feedback_d: Incorrect. WegGL is collection of function calls and it is not explicitly object-oriented.

    Object-oriented programming facilitates WebGL programming because ... (Select all that apply.)
