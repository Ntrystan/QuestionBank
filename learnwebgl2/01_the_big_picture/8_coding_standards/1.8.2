    :feedback_a: Correct, use only lower case in file names. (For some operating systems, Abc.txt and abc.txt are different files, while for other operating systems, they are the same file.)
    :feedback_b: Incorrect. Don't use upper case letters.
    :feedback_c: Incorrect. Don't use upper case letters.
