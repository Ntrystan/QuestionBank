  :answer_a: They can be applied to only the vertices of a model and the entire model is transformed as expected.
  :answer_b: They allow a models' size to be manipulated.
  :answer_c: There is only three basic transformations which makes transformations less complex.
  :answer_d: They are simple to understand.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. We can transform an entire triangle by the transformation of just its three vertices.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This is true, but it is not the most important aspect.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. There are actually other transformations in addition to the three listed, but beyond that, the three transformations can be combined in interesting ways to produce complex motion.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. This is true, but it is not the most important aspect.

  What is the most important aspect of affine transformations?
