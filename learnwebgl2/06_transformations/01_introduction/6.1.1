  :feedback_a: Correct. Changing location is fundamentally what translate does.
  :feedback_b: Correct. Changing location is a side-effect of scaling if the object is not centered at the origin.
  :feedback_c: Correct. Changing location is a side-effect of rotation if the object is not centered at the origin.

  Which of these transformations will change the location of an object if
  it is not centered at the origin? (Select all that apply.)
