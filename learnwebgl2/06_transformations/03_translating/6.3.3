  :feedback_a: Correct. You add the vector to every vertex in the model.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. The values you add must be consistent with the vertex component values (x, y, z).
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. These values would move 1 unit in the x direction, 2 units in the y direction, and 3 units in the z direction, but this has nothing to do with the vector <dx, dy, dz>.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. In general we have 3 translation values, and we generically call them tx, ty, and tz, but this has nothing to do with the vector <dx, dy, dz>.

  Translating a model in the direction of a vector <dx, dy, dz> would use what translation values?
