  :answer_a: A transformation matrix for vertices should always include a projection, camera, and model transforms.
  :answer_b: It wasn't really necessary, but done for consistency.
  :answer_c: So the code would not be confusing.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. Always include all three transformations for a vertex shader program transform.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The transformations are required.

  Why was the :code:`projection` and :code:`camera` transformations included for both the base and the forearm transformations?
