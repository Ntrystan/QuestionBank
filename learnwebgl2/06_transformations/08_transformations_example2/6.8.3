  :answer_a: The forearm does not rotate with the base about the Y axis.
  :answer_b: It works fine!
  :answer_c: The forearm does not rotate with the base about the Z axis.
  :answer_d: The forearm rotates in the opposite direction.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect.

  If the base rotation matrix was not included in the transformation for the forearm rendering,
  what would be the visual result? (Hint: Modify the code to see!)
