  :answer_a: So the event object can access and modify it.
  :answer_b: Because all variables in a class should be public by default.
  :answer_c: So the forearm can be rotated by the render function.
  :answer_d: Because public variables make debugging easier.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The event handler in the event object modifies the angle based on changes to the slider bar.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Limiting public variables makes debugging easier.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. All variables, both public and private, are accessible to the render function.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Limiting public variables makes debugging easier.

  Why was the angle for rotating the forearm made a public class variable?
