  :feedback_a: Correct. It is a rotation of 30 degrees about the Z axis. (Note that the z components do not change.)
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. (It may look a little like a scale, but it is not. The size remains unchanged!)
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. (To be a translation, it needs non-zero values in the last column.)
  :feedback_d: Incorrect.
