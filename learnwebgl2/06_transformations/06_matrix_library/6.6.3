  :feedback_a: Correct. Only the first parameter is modified and contains the results of the matrix multiplications.

  You need to multiple 3 matrices together, :code:`a` times :code:`b` times :code:`c`, and
  store the results in matrix :code:`q`. You can do this using the
  :code:`multiplySeries()` function like this:

  .. Code-block:: Javascript

    m.multiplySeries(q,a,b,c);

  Which of the parameters to the :code:`multiplySeries()` function are modified by the function call?
  (Select all that apply.)
