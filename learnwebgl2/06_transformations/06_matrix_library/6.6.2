  You have created an instance of the :code:`GlMatrix4x4` class called :code:`m` and you
  want to use it to create a 4x4 transformation matrix called :code:`sam`. Which of the following code examples
  accomplish this?

  - :code:`sam = m.create();`

    + Correct.

  - :code:`sam = new GlMatrix4x4().create();`

    - Incorrect. (While this will work in theory, it creates an unnecessary :code:`GlMatrix4x4` object.)

  - :code:`sam = new GlMatrix4x4();`

    - Incorrect. This creates an instance of the :code:`GlMatrix4x4` class.

  - :code:`m.create();`

    - Incorrect. It creates a new 4x4 transformation matrix but does not assign it to a variable so it can be used.
