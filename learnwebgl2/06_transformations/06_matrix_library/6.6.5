  :feedback_a: Correct. The angle is 30 degrees and the axis of rotation is the y axis, <0,1,0>.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This rotates about the x axis, <1,0,0>.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. This rotates about the z axis, <0,0,1>.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. This is missing the 3 parameters that define the axis of rotation.

  Which of the following statements set a matrix called :code:`nice` to a
  rotation transformation that rotates a model 30 degrees about the y axis?
