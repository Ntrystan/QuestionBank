  :answer_a: Collapses all vertices to (0,0,0), thus losing all 3D information about the model.
  :answer_b: Performs the "unity" operation which leaves the model unchanged.
  :answer_c: Makes the model larger.
  :answer_d: Makes the model smaller.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. (The "unity" operation uses a scale factor of 1.0.)
  :feedback_c: Incorrect.
  :feedback_d: Partially correct, but there is a better answer.

  Uniform scaling of a model by 0.0 does what to a model?
