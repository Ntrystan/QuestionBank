  :answer_c: the same scale factor as the x axis
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. This leave the z components of all vertices unchanged because multiplying by 1.0 does not change them.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. This makes all vertex z components be 0.0, which collapses your entire 3D model to a single plane.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect.

  If you want to scale the x and y dimensions of a model, but leave the z dimension unchanged,
  what scale factor should you use for the z scale factor?
