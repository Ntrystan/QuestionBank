  :answer_a: Y-Z plane
  :answer_b: X plane
  :answer_c: X-Y plane
  :answer_d: X-Z plane
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. Since the x values become negative, the model goes on the opposite side of the Y-Z plane.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. (A single axis does not define a plane.)
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Mirroring about the X-Y plane requires a negative z scale factor.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Mirroring about the X-Z plane requires a negative y scale factor.

  Using a negative value for the X scale factor mirrors a model about which plane?
