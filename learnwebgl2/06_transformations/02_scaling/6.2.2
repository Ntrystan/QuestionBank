  :answer_a: When the model is not centered at the origin.
  :answer_b: When the model is composed of only triangles.
  :answer_c: When the model is centered at the origin.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. An object away from the origin will move further away from the origin when enlarged and closer to the origin when shrunk.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. All models are composed of only triangles. This has no impact on scaling.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. If the model is centered at the origin, then all vertices move the same percentage away or towards the origin, which keeps the object in the same relative location.

  Scaling changes the location of a model under what circumstances?
