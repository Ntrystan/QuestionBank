  Suppose you want to render a model defined by 200 triangles and you
  want to color each triangle with a unique color. The triangles are
  defined by 3 vertices per triangle, with each vertex defined by 3 floats.
  The color values are stored as RGB values in a separate *object buffer*.
  What is the required size for the color *object buffer*?
