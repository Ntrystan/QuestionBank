  :answer_a: the rendering is very slow.
  :answer_b: it doesn't work.
  :answer_c: the rendering is too fast for real-time graphics.
  :answer_d: shader programs must always be executed on multiple triangles at one time.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. You lose most the GPU's builtin efficiencies.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. See the first WebGL program in this lesson for an example that works.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. It is not possible to render models too fast!
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. A shader program can execute on a single vertex if your set the gl.drawArrays' count parameter to 1.

  Rendering a model by calling :code:`gl.drawArrays()` for each individual triangle is a bad idea because...
