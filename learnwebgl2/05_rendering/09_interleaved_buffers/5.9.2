  :answer_a: The buffer object contains interleaved data.
  :answer_b: Data will be retrieved from this buffer getting the 3rd, 4th and 5th values from each group of vertex data.
  :answer_c: Each vertex is define by 7 floats.
  :answer_d: Data will be retrieved from this buffer getting the 1st, 2nd and 3rd values from each group of vertex data.
  :correct: a,b,c
  :feedback_a: Correct. Because the "stride" and "offset" parameters are not zero.
  :feedback_b: Correct. Because the "offset" is bytes_per_float*2 and the "size" is 3.
  :feedback_c: Correct. Because the "stride" parameter skips 7 values.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. To access the 1st, 2nd and 3rd values, the "offset" value would need to be zero.

  You are studying example code and you come across the following lines:

  .. Code-Block:: JavaScript

    // buffer_data is a Float32Array;
    bytes_per_float = buffer_data[0].BYTES_PER_ELEMENT;
    gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer_object_id);
    gl.vertexAttribPointer(variable_location,  3, gl.FLOAT, false,
                           bytes_per_float*7, bytes_per_float*2);

  Which of the following statements are true? (Select all that apply.)
