  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. Vertex 0 is on the back, bottom of the pyramid.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Vertex 2 is the front, right vertex.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Vertex 3 is the front, left vertex.

  In the above WebGL program, which vertex would need to be modified to raise the
  apex of the pyramid (it's highest point on the y axis) one unit higher?
  (Note that arrays are zero sub-scripted.)
