  :answer_a: Yes, but a separate execution of the graphics pipeline is required for each distinct color.
  :answer_b: Yes, a single execution of the graphics pipeline could render using different colors.
  :answer_c: No, the shader program only allows for a single color.
  :answer_d: No, the shader program is only ever executed once.
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The color can be set before each execution of the graphics pipeline.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. For a single execution of the graphics pipeline, the color is a constant value.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The shader program allows for a single color during one graphics pipeline execution, but you can execute the graphics pipeline multiple times.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Actually, the graphics pipeline is typically executed at least one for each separate model.

  Using the :code:`uniform_color.vert` and :code:`uniform_color.frag` shaders as described in this lesson, is it
  possible to render models in different colors?
