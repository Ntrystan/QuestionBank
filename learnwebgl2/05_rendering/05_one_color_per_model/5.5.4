  :correct: a,b
  :feedback_a: Correct.
  :feedback_b: Correct. Assuming the variable "my_array" holds 4 floats.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. The function is expecting 4 values, but the call only sends two.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. The function is expecting a single array parameter that hold 3 values, not 3 separate values.

  Which of the following function calls are valid? (They are setting the value of a uniform variable in a shader program.) (Select all that apply.)
