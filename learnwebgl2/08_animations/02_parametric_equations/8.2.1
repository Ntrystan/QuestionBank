  :answer_a: "time"
  :answer_b: distance
  :answer_c: speed
  :answer_d: acceleration
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. The answer is in quotes because the t value is normalized to a range from 0.0 to 1.0.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. You could think of t as a percentage of distance, but it is more related to time.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Speed is the distance traveled over a set unit of time.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. Acceleration is the change in speed.

  The parametric parameter, :code:`t`, is best thought of in terms of what property?
