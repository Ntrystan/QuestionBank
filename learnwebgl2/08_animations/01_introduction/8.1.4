  :feedback_a: Correct. This would render a new image for each refresh cycle of the monitor.
  :feedback_b: Correct. This would render a new image for every other refresh cycle of the monitor.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. 12 is not evenly divisible into 30, so there is no way to update the frames on a uniform time interval.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. 20 is not evenly divisible into 30, so there is no way to update the frames on a uniform time interval.

  If a WebGL program is executing on a system whose monitor is being
  refreshed 30 times per second, which of the following are valid
  *refresh rates* for an animation? (Select all that apply.)
