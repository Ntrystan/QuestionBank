  To create a Bezier parametric equation that defines constant speed (no acceleration) along a path
  requires which of the following criteria, even when the path is non-linear?

  - the length of the vectors :raw-html:`&lt;` p1-p0 :raw-html:`&gt;`, :raw-html:`&lt;` p2-p1 :raw-html:`&gt;`, and :raw-html:`&lt;` p3-p2 :raw-html:`&gt;` must be equal.

    + Correct. If the three vectors have the same length, the path defines constant speed.

  - the control points must be co-linear.

    - Incorrect. This makes the path linear, but there are many possibilities for the speed (as lesson 8.4 explains).

  - the length of the vectors :raw-html:`&lt;` p1-p0 :raw-html:`&gt;` and :raw-html:`&lt;` p3-p2 :raw-html:`&gt;` must be equal.

    - Incorrect. This makes the speed and acceleration symmetrical at the beginning and ending of the path, but it does not make the speed constant.

  - the number of frames must be equal to the number of changes in the parameter t.

    - Incorrect. This is a nonsensical statement.
