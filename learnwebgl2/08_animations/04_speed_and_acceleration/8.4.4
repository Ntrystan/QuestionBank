  :answer_a: Yes, because for a frame-ratae of "n frame/sec", time changes by 1/n between each frame.
  :answer_b: No, the "change in t" between frames can vary without side effects.
  :answer_c: Yes, because we need simple calculations to make the rendering fast.
  :answer_d: No, because the value of "t" does not represent anything "real world".
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Correct. "t" represents time and time always changes consistently.
  :feedback_b: Incorrect. "t" represents time and if it changes arbitrarily, syncing the motion of multiple objects becomes impossible.
  :feedback_c: Incorrect. Fast rendering comes from the GPU.
  :feedback_d: Incorrect. "t" represents time, which is very real!

  A parametric equation calculates intermediate values as :code:`t` changes
  from 0.0 to 1.0. Should the change in values of :code:`t` be the same between
  every frame?
