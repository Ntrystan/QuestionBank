   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the while loop continued as long as i1 and i2 where greater than or equal to 0.
   :feedback_b: This loops and only increments count when the same value is in x1 and x2, but it doesn't compare the values at index 0 since it stops when either index is 0.
   :feedback_c: It may appear that the indicies get out of synchronization, but check out the else if and else code.
   :feedback_d: The very first time trough the loop the values at the two indicies are equal and count is incremented.

   What is the value of ``count`` after the following code has executed?

   .. code-block:: java

     int[] x1 = {1, 2, 4, 7};
     int[] x2 = {1, 2, 5, 7};
     int i1 = x1.length - 1;
     int i2 = x2.length - 1;
     int count = 0;
     while ((i1 > 0 ) && (i2 > 0 ))
     {
        if (x1[i1] == x2[i2])
        {
           count++;
           i1--;
           i2--;
        }
        else if (x1[i1] < x2[i2])
        {
           i2--;
        }
        else
        { // x1[i1] > x2[i2]
           i1--;
        }
     }
