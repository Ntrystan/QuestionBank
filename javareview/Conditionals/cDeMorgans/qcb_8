   :answer_a: first case
   :answer_b: second case
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This will print if x is greater than or equal 3 and y is less than or equal 2.  In this case x is greater than 3 but y is not less than or equal 2.
   :feedback_b: This will print if x is less than 3 or y is greater than 2.  Think of it as the negation of the negation which cancels the negation.

   What is printed when the following code executes and x equals 4 and y equals 3?

   .. code-block:: java

     if (!(x < 3 || y > 2)) System.out.println("first case");
     else System.out.println("second case");
