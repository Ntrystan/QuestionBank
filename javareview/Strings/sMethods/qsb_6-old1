   :feedback_a: Strings are immutable, meaning they don't change.  Any method that changes a string returns a new string.  So s1 never changes.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s2 and it was substring(0,2) not (0,1)
   :feedback_c: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s2, not s1.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the question was what is the value of s3, not s1.

   What is the value of s1 after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = "Hi";
     String s2 = s1.substring(0,1);
     String s3 = s2.toLowerCase();
