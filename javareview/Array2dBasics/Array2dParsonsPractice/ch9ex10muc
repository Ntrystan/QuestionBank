   The following program segment is a method that should accept a two-dimensional int array, and return a single-dimensional (normal) int array containing the max of each row.  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed code from the left to the right and put them in order with the correct indention so that the code would work correctly.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
