   :feedback_a: I is wrong because <code>y</code> is a private field and thus can not be directly accessed from code in a client class.
   :feedback_b: I is wrong because <code>y</code>  is a private field and thus can not be directly accessed from code in a client class. II is correct because <code>EnhancedItem</code> has <code>setY</code> as a public method. III is correct because <code>EnhancedItem</code> inherits the public method <code>setX</code> from <code>Item</code>.
   :feedback_c: I is wrong because <code>y</code>  is a private field and thus can not be directly accessed from code in a client class.
   :feedback_d: I is wrong because <code>y</code>  is a private field and thus can not be directly accessed from code in a client class.  II is correct because <code>EnhancedItem</code> has <code>setY</code> as a public method.  III is correct because <code>EnhancedItem</code> inherits the public method <code>setX</code> from <code>Item</code>.
   :feedback_e: I is wrong because <code>y</code>  is a private field and thus can not be directly accessed from code in a client class.

   Given the following class declarations, and ``EnhancedItem enItemObj = new EnhancedItem();`` in a client class, which of the following statements would compile?

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Item
      {
         private int x;

         public void setX(int theX)
         {
            x = theX;
         }
         // ... other methods not shown
      }

      public class EnhancedItem extends Item
      {
         private int y;

         public void setY(int theY)
         {
            y = theY;
         }

        // ... other methods not shown
      }

      I. enItemObj.y = 32;
      II. enItemObj.setY(32);
      III. enItemObj.setX(52);
