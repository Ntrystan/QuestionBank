   The following method should add up all of the elements in the passed-in array -- so {1,2,3,12} should return 18 (Note when the method is called, the index will always start off as 0).  But the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>two extra blocks</b> that are not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
