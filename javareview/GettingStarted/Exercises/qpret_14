    :answer_a: The search value is not in the array
    :answer_b: The search value is the last element in the array
    :answer_c: The value is in the middle of the array.
    :answer_d: The search value is the first element in the array.
    :answer_e: Sequential Search can never be faster than Binary Search.
    :correct: d
    :feedback_a: If the search value is not in the array, a sequential search will have to check every item in the array before failing, a binary search will be faster.
    :feedback_b: In this case a sequential search will have to check every element before finding the correct one, whereas a binary search will not.
    :feedback_c: Results will differ depending on the exact location of the element, but Binary Search will still find the element faster while Sequential will have to check more elements.
    :feedback_d: Only when the search value is the first item in the array, and thus the first value encountered in sequential search, will sequential be faster than binary.
    :feedback_e: When the search value is the first element, Sequential will always be faster, as it will only need to check one element.

    Under which of these conditions will a sequential search be faster than a binary search?
