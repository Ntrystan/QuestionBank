   :answer_a: I and III
   :answer_b: All are true
   :answer_c: I, III, and IV
   :answer_d: II and IV
   :answer_e: III and IV
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: These are both true, but one more is also true.
   :feedback_b: Since s1 and s2 were created using the new operator they do not refer to the same object so s1 == s2 is false.
   :feedback_c: I is true since they have the same characters in the same order.  III and IV are both true since they refer to the same object.
   :feedback_d: II is not true.  Since s1 and s2 were created using the new operator they do not refer to the same object so s1 == s2 is false.
   :feedback_e: These are both true, but one more is also true.

   Given the following code.

   .. code-block:: java

      String s1 = new String("hi");
      String s2 = new String("hi");
      String s3 = s2;

      Which of the following would return true:
      I.  s1.equals(s2)
      II. s1 == s2
      III. s2.equals(s3);
      IV. s2 == s3;
