   :answer_e: 10
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if the variable col was 0 because then it would add 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 which is 4.
   :feedback_b: The variable col is 2, so it adds 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 which is 8.
   :feedback_c: This would be correct if the variable col was 1 because then it would add 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 which is 9.
   :feedback_d: This would be correct if the variable col was 3 becuase then it would add 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 which is 12.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if we were adding the values in the 3rd row (row = 2) instead of the 3rd column.  This would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10.

   Consider the following code segment.  What value is in sum after this code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

       int[][] matrix = {{1,1,2,2},{1,2,2,4},{1,2,3,4},{1,4,1,2}};

       int sum = 0;
       int col = matrix[0].length - 2;
       for (int row = 0; row < 4; row++)
       {
          sum = sum + matrix[row][col];
       }
