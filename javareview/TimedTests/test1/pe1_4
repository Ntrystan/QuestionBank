   :answer_a: I and II only
   :answer_b: I, II, III, and V
   :answer_c: All will return true
   :answer_d: I, II, and III only
   :answer_e: III, IV, and V only
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: How about III and V?  Since int3 was set to int2 they do refer to the same object.
   :feedback_b: The variables int1 and int2 refer to two different objects (even though they have the same value) so IV will be false.
   :feedback_c: Look at IV.  Are int1 and int2 referring to the same object?
   :feedback_d: V is also true.
   :feedback_e: I and II are also true since they have the same value.  IV is not since they don't refere to the same object.

   Given the following code.  Which of the following would return true?

   .. code-block:: java

     Integer int1 = new Integer(3);
     Integer int2 = new Integer(3);
     Integer int3 = int2;

     I. (int3.equals(int2))
     II. (int1.equals(int2))
     III. (int3 == int2)
     IV. (int1 == int2)
     V. (int2 == int3)
