   :answer_a: arr[col][i] += sum;
   :answer_b: arr[i][col] += sum;
   :answer_c: sum += arr[i][col];
   :answer_d: sum += arr[col][i];
   :answer_e: sum += arr[col][col];
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This assigns the value of sum to a space in the array. Remember that assignment occurs from right to left.
   :feedback_b: This assigns the value of sum to a space in the array. Remember that assignment occurs from right to left.
   :feedback_c: Correct! This adds the value in [i][col] to sum, and i loops through every row in the array.
   :feedback_d: This method sums the values at a specified row, not a specified column. Check the array indexing.
   :feedback_e: Because col does not change, this method simply sums the value at arr[col][col] i times.

   The method ``columnSum`` is shown below. ``columnSum`` returns the sum of all of the values in a specified column ``col`` of a 2-D array. Which of the following should replace ``/* to be completed */`` so that the method will work as intended?

   .. code-block:: java

      public int columnSum (int col, int[][] arr)
      {
          int sum = 0;

          for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
          {
              /* to be completed */
          }

          return sum;
      }
