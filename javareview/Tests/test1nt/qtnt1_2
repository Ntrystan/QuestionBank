   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: This would be true if we called mystery(2).
   :feedback_b: The argument is 4 so will have 4 recursive calls and then return 3 when we get to mystery(1). Each call will multiply our result by 3, so you can think of this as 3 raised to the 4th power (or 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81).
   :feedback_c: This value is returned when we call mystery(1), since 1 is the base case and doesn't result in a recursive call.
   :feedback_d: This value would be returned from mystery(5).
   :feedback_e: This value would be returned from mystery(3).

   Consider the following recursive method. What does ``mystery(4)`` return?

   .. code-block:: java

      public int mystery(int m)
      {
        if (m == 1)
        {
            return 3;
        } else
        {
            return 3 * mystery(m - 1);
        }
      }
