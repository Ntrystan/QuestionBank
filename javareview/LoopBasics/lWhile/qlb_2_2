   :answer_a: var1 = 1, var2 = 1
   :answer_b: var1 = 2, var2 = 0
   :answer_c: var1 = 3, var2 = -1
   :answer_d: var1 = 0, var2 = 2
   :answer_e: The loop will cause a run-time error with a division by zero
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: The loop stops one of two ways, when var2 = 0 or when var1 / var2 = 0 - neither is true in this case
   :feedback_b: The loop stopped because var2 = 0.  After the first execution of the loop var1 = 1 and var2 = 1.  After the second execution of the loop var1 = 2 and var2 = 0.  This stops the loop and doesn't execute the second part of the complex conditional.
   :feedback_c: The loop stops one of two ways, when var2 = 0 or when var1 / var2 = 0 - neither is true in this case
   :feedback_d: The loop stops one of two ways, when var2 = 0 or when var1 / var2 = 0 - neither is true in this case
   :feedback_e: Even though var1 = 2 and var2 = 0 when the conditional is executed the first condition is true so the rest of the complex conditional won't execute.

   What are the values of var1 and var2 when the code finishes executing?

   .. code-block:: java

     int var1 = 0;
     int var2 = 2;

     while ((var2 != 0) && ((var1 / var2) >= 0))
     {
        var1 = var1 + 1;
        var2 = var2 -1;
     }
