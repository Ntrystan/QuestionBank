   Each time Alex re-reads his Java Methods book (which happens every month), he 
   learns 10% of whatever material he didnâ€™t know before. He needs to score 
   at least 95% on the comprehensive exam to become a certified Java 
   developer. When Alex started, he knew nothing about Java. First, write the body 
   of the get95Percent method so that it simulates Alex's learning progress and 
   returns the  number of  months it will take him to get ready for the exam. Second, 
   write the body of the main method so that it displays the result of calling your
   get95Percent method formatted into years and months.
