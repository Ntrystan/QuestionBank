   :answer_a: I only
   :answer_b: II only
   :answer_c: II and III only
   :answer_d: I and II only
   :answer_e: I, II, and III
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Loop I will produce this output, but it is not the only loop that will output these values.
   :feedback_b: Loop II will produce this output, but it is not the only loop that will output these values.
   :feedback_c: Loop II is correct, but loop III will produce the reverse output, 43210.
   :feedback_d: Both of these loops will have the correct output. They iterate (and print each value) starting from 0 until the max value which we defined earlier in our code.
   :feedback_e: While loop I and II will produce the correct output, loop III will actually produce the reverse of the correct output.

   Which of these loops will output ``01234``?

   .. code-block:: java

      int max = 5;

      //Loop I
      for (int i = 0; i < max; i++)
      {
         System.out.print(i);
      }


      //Loop II
      int j = 0;
      while (j < max)
      {
         System.out.print(j);
         j++;
      }


      //Loop III
      int k = 0;
      for (int i = max; i > 0; i--)
      {
         System.out.print(i);
      }
