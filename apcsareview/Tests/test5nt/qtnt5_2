   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: n != 0
   :feedback_b: There are some recursive calls since n % 2 != 1
   :feedback_c: Subtracts 2 from original number of 8, so could never call an odd number to be multiplied
   :feedback_d: Will recursively call 8 -2, then 6-2, and lastly 4-2
   :feedback_e: Subtracts 2 from original number of 8, so could never call an odd number to be multiplied

   Consider the following method. What will be returned by a call to ``multiply(8)``?

   .. code-block:: java

     public int multiply(int n)
     {
         if (n == 0)
             return 1;
         else if(n % 2 == 1)
           return n;
         else
             return n * multiply(n - 2);
     }
