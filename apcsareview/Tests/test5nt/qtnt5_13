    :feedback_e: Second for loop goes until colum <= row index

    A square matrix is declared as
        ``int[][] mat = new int [SIZE][SIZE]``

    where ``SIZE`` is an appropriate integer constant. Consider the code below.

    If mat is initialized to be:

    .. code-block:: java

        2 6 3
        4 5 1
        7 1 2

    What value will be returned by a call to ``sum(mat)``?

    .. code-block:: Java

      public static int sum(int[][] mat)
      {
          int total = 0;
          for(int r = 0; r < mat.length; r++)
          {
              for(int c = 0; c <= r; c++)
              {
                  total += mat[r][c];
              }
          }
          return total;
      }
