      :feedback_a: This is true because !false && !false becomes true && true
      :feedback_b: If either a or b (or both a AND b) is true whole expression becomes false
      :feedback_c: If either a or b (or both a AND b) is true whole expression becomes false
      :feedback_d: If either a or b (or both a AND b) is true whole expression becomes false
      :feedback_e: If either a or b (or both a AND b) is true whole expression becomes false


      Suppose ``a and b`` are ``boolean`` variables. The expression below
          ``!a && !b``

        ...will evaluate to ``false`` whenever

         I. a and b are both false
         II. a is false and b is true
         III. a is true and b is false
