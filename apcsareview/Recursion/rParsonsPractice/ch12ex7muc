   The following method should repeat the passed-in string a set number of times -- so repeatThis("hi", 3) should return "hihihi".  But the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>two extra blocks</b> that are not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>
