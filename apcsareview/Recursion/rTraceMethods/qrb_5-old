   :answer_b: 120
   :answer_c: 720
   :answer_d: 30
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be correct if it was factorial(0), but don't forget the recursive calls.
   :feedback_b: This would be correct if it was factorial(5), but this is factorial(6).
   :feedback_c: If you remember that factorial(5) was 120 then this is just 6 * 120 = 720.
   :feedback_d: It doesn't return 6 * 5 it returns 6 * factorial(5).

        Given the method defined below what does the following return: factorial(6)?

    .. code-block:: java
     :linenos:

     public static int factorial(int n)
     {
        if (n == 0)
           return 1;
        else
           return n * factorial(n-1);
     }
