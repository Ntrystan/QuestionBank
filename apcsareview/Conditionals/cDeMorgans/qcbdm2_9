   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This will be printed if x is greater than or equal to 3 or y is less than or equal to 2.  In this case x is greater than 3 so the first condition is true.
   :feedback_b: This will be printed if x is less than 3 and y is greater than 2.

   What is printed when the following code executes and x equals 4 and y equals 3?

   .. code-block:: java

     if (!(x < 3 && y > 2)) System.out.println("first case");
     else System.out.println("second case");
