   :answer_a: (x > 15 && x < 18) && (x > 10)
   :answer_b: (y < 20) || (x > 15 && x < 18)
   :answer_c: (x > 10)|| (y < 20)
   :answer_d: (x < 10 && y > 20) && (x < 15 || x > 18)
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This can't be right as it's only checking the x variable, however the original statement can solely depend on the y variable in some cases.
   :feedback_b: There's a third condition on x that can affect the output of the statement which is not considered in this solution.
   :feedback_c: This expression would be true whenever x is > 10 or y < 20.  The (x > 15 && x < 18) will be true for x = 16 or 17 which is included in (x > 10).
   :feedback_d: This is the negation of the original statement, thus returning incorrect values.

   Assuming that x and y have been declared as valid integer values, which of the following is equivalent to this statement?

     (x > 15 && x < 18) || (x > 10 || y < 20)
