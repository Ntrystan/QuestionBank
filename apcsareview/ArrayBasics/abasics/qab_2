   :answer_a: <code>highScores.length</code>
   :answer_b: <code>highScores.length - 1</code>
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Look at the example above when we were setting the values for the <i>highScore</i> array.
   :feedback_b: Since the first element in an array is at index 0 the last element is the length minus 1.

   Which index is the last element in an array called ``highScores`` at?
