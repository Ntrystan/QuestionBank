   :answer_a: The value in <code>b[0]</code> does not occur anywhere else in the array
   :answer_b: Array <code>b</code> is sorted
   :answer_c: Array <code>b</code> is not sorted
   :answer_d: Array <code>b</code> contains no duplicates
   :answer_e: The value in <code>b[0]</code> is the smallest value in the array
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The assertion denotes that <code>b[0]</code> occurs only once, regardless of the order or value of the other array values.
   :feedback_b: The array does not necessarily need to be in order for the assertion to be true.
   :feedback_c: We can't tell if it is sorted or not from this assertion.
   :feedback_d: The only value that must not have a duplicate is <code>b[0]</code>
   :feedback_e: <code>b[0]</code> can be any value, so long as no other array element is equal to it.

   Which of the following statements is a valid conclusion. Assume that variable ``b`` is an array of ``k`` integers and that the following is true:

     b[0] != b[i] for all i from 1 to k-1
