   The following program segment is a method that should return a new array of length 2 containing the middle two elements of a given array of integers of even length (the parameter) -- so {1,2,3,4} should return {2,3}.  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution. </p>
