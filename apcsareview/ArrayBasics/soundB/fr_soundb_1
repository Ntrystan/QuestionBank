   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: A while loop is the best choice when you don't know the number of times you need to loop.
   :feedback_b: You could use a for loop, but typically a while loop is used when you want to loop while a condition is true.
   :feedback_c: A for-each loop would only allow you to loop through all the values, but you first want to loop while there are leading zeros.

   Which loop would be best for this problem?
