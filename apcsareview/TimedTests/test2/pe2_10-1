   :answer_e: Nothing will be printed due to an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if the loop was printing each character twice and was incrementing the index by 1, but it prints two characters at a time and increments the index by 2.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if the loop was incremented by 2 instead of 1.
   :feedback_c: This code loops through the string printing 2 characters at a time.  The last time through the loop the index is test.length() - 2.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if the loop was printing 3 characters at a time instead of 2.  Remember that the substring doesn't include the character at the specified last index.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if the loop stopped when index was less than the string length instead of one less than the string length.

   Given the following code segment, what is printed when it is executed?

   .. code-block:: java

     String test = "123456";
     for (int index = 0; index < test.length() - 1; index = index + 1)
     {
          System.out.print(test.substring(index,index+2));
     }
