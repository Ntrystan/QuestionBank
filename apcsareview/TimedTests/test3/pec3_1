   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was adding up all the values in the third column, the one at index 2.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was adding up all the values in the first column, the one at index 0.
   :feedback_c: This code adds up all the values in the second column, the one at index 1 since column indicies start at 0.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was adding up all the values in the last column, the one at index 3.
   :feedback_e: This would be true if it was adding up all the values in the first row, but the row changes each time through the for loop.

   What is the value of total after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

       int[][] matrix = {{4, 5, 6, 7}, {0, 1, 2, 3}, {3, 2, 1, 0}, {8, 9, 1, 2}};

       int total = 0;
       for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++)
       {
          total = total + matrix[row][1];
       }
