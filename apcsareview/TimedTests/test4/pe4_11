   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be true if we asked what the value of s3 was.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if we asked what the value of s2 was.
   :feedback_c: Strings are immutable in Java which means they never change.  Any method that looks like it changes a string returns a new string object.  Since s1 was never changed to refer to a different string it stays the same.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if we asked what the value of s4 was.
   :feedback_e: How could this have happened?

   What is value of s1 after the code below executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = "Hi There";
     String s2 = s1;
     String s3 = s2;
     String s4 = s1;
     s2 = s2.toUpperCase();
     s3 = s3.toLowerCase();
     s4 = null;
