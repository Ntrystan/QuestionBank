   :answer_d: class
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: The parent class is the superclass, but this is not the Java keyword for declaring the parent class.
   :feedback_b: The class you are inheriting from is called the parent or superclass, but this is not the Java keyword.
   :feedback_c: The extends keyword is used to specify the parent class.
   :feedback_d: The class keyword is used to declare a class, but not the parent class.

    What Java keyword is used to specify the parent class?
