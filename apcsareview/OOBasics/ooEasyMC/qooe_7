   :answer_a: Create one class <code>PublishedMaterial</code> with the requested fields plus type.
   :answer_b: Create classes <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code>, and <code>AudioTape</code> with the requested fields.
   :answer_c: Create one class <code>BookStore</code> with the requested fields plus type.
   :answer_d: Create classes for each.
   :answer_e: Create the class <code>PublishedMaterial</code> with children classes of <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code>, and <code>AudioTape</code>.
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This will complicate the process of retrieving objects based on their type. Also if we need to add information that is specific to <code>Book</code> or <code>Movie</code> or <code>AudioTape</code> it would be best if these were subclasses of <code>PublishedMaterial</code>.
   :feedback_b: This involves writing more code than is necessary (usually people copy and paste the shared code) and makes it harder to fix errors. It would be better to put common fields and methods in the superclass <code>PublishedMaterial</code> and have <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code>, and <code>AudioTape</code> be subclasses.
   :feedback_c: The class name, <code>BookStore</code>, seems to imply the thing that keeps track of the store. This would be an appropriate class name for an object that handles the items in the <code>Bookstore</code>. However, for the published material, it would be better to use a superclass <code>PublishedMaterial</code> and subclasses for <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code> and <code>AudioTape</code>.
   :feedback_d: This is more classes than is necessary. Items such as <code>Title</code>, <code>Price</code>, <code>ID</code>, <code>Author</code> and <code>DatePublished</code> are simple variables that do not need a class of their own but should be fields in a <code>PublishedMaterial</code> superclass, with <code>Movie</code>, <code>AudioTape</code> and <code>Book</code> as subclasses.
   :feedback_e: We will need to get objects based on their type so we should create classes for <code>Book</code>, <code>Movie</code>, and <code>AudioTape</code>. They have common fields so we should put these in a common superclass <code>PublishedMaterial</code>.

   A bookstore is working on an on-line ordering system. For each type of published material (books, movies, audio tapes) they need to track the id, title, author(s), date published, and price. Which of the following would be the best design?
