   :answer_a: Determines the amount of space needed for an object and creates the object
   :answer_b: Names the new object
   :answer_c: Return to free storage all the memory used by this instance of the class.
   :answer_d: Initialize the fields in the object
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: The object is already created before the constructor is called so there would be no need for this in the constructor.
   :feedback_b: Constructors do not name the object.
   :feedback_c: Constructors do not free any memory. In Java the freeing of memory is done when the object is no longer referenced.
   :feedback_d: A constructor merely initializes the fields to their default values or in the case of a parameterized constructor, to the values passed in to the constructor.

   What best describes the purpose of a class's constructor?
