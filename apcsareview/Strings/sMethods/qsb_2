   :feedback_a: Is this the value of s3?  What does toLowerCase do?
   :feedback_b: How does substring work?  Does it include the character at the end index?
   :feedback_c: What does toLowerCase do?
   :feedback_d: s2 is set to just "H" and s3 is set to changing all characters in s2 to lower case.

   What is the value of s3 after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     String s1 = "Hi";
     String s2 = s1.substring(0,1);
     String s3 = s2.toLowerCase();
