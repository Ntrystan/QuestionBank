   :answer_c: 118
   :answer_d: 121
   :answer_e: 214
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: That would be the answer if these were all decimal values, but they are not.
   :feedback_b: 12 in octal is 10 in decimal and 111 in binary is 7 in decimal so this is 123 - 10 + 7.
   :feedback_c: This would be the answer if it was 123 - 12 + 111 (binary) but the 12 is in octal.
   :feedback_d: Remember that the rightmost digit in any base is the base to the 0th power which is 1.
   :feedback_e: Remember that the 111 is in binary (base 2).  Its decimal value is 7.

   Which of the following would be the correct result from the following expression: 123 (decimal) - 12 (octal) + 111 (binary)?
