   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: This would be enough to represent 32 distinct values, so that is more then enough to represent 25 distinct values.
   :feedback_b: This would only be enough to represent 16 distinct values (2 to the 4th).
   :feedback_c: This is more than you need.  2 to the 6th is 64.

   How many bits would you need to represent 25 distinct values?
