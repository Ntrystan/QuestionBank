   :answer_b: double
   :answer_c: boolean
   :answer_d: String
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: The integer type (int) can't be used to represent decimal numbers so you couldn't use it if you had any cents.
   :feedback_b: The double type can be used to represent an amount of money.
   :feedback_c: Java uses boolean for values that are only true or false.
   :feedback_d: While you can use a string to represent the amount of money you have it is easier to do calculations on the numeric types (int or double).

   What type should you use to represent the amount of money you have?
