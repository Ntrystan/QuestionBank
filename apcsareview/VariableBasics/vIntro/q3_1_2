   :feedback_a: The number of people is a whole number so using an integer make sense.
   :feedback_b: Can you have 2.5 people in a household?
   :feedback_c: Is the number of people something that is either true or false?
   :feedback_d: While you can use a string, a number is better for doing calculations with (like finding the average number of people in a household).
