   :answer_a: [1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 3]
   :answer_b: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   :answer_c: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   :answer_d: [1, 4, 2, 6, 3]
   :answer_e: [1, 2, 4, 6, 3]
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: The set replaces the 3 with the 4 so this can't be right.
   :feedback_b: The add with an index of 2 and a value of 5 adds the 5 at index 2 not 3.  Remember that the first index is 0.
   :feedback_c: The add method that takes just a value as a parameter adds that value to the end of the list.  The set replaces the value at that index with the new value.  The add with parameters of an index and a value puts the passed value at that index and moves any existing values by one index to the right (increments the index).
   :feedback_d: The add with an index of 2 and a value of 5 adds the 5 at index 2 not 1.  Remember that the first index is 0.
   :feedback_e: When you declare and create a collection class you can specify the type of the items in it.

   What is printed as a result of executing the following code segment?

   .. code-block:: java

     List<Integer> aList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
     aList.add(new Integer(1));
     aList.add(new Integer(2));
     aList.add(1, new Integer(5));
     aList.set(1, new Integer(4));
     aList.add(new Integer(6));
     aList.add(new Integer(3));
     System.out.println(aList);
