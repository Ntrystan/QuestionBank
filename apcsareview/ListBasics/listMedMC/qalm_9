   :feedback_a: This would be true if it was <code>numList.add(numList.size() - i, obj)</code>
   :feedback_b: This would be true if it was <code>mystery(1)</code>
   :feedback_c: Each value is removed one at a time and added to the end of the list which results in the same list.
   :feedback_d: This would be true if it was <code>mystery(2)</code>
   :feedback_e: This would be true if it was <code>mystery(4)</code>

   Assume that ``numList`` has been initialized with the following Integer objects: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].  What is the value of ``numList`` after ``mystery(5)`` executes?

   .. code-block:: java

     private List<Integer> numList;
     public void mystery(int n)
     {
         for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
         {
             Integer obj = numList.remove(0);
             numList.add(obj);
         }
     }
