   The following program segment is a method that should return the smallest int given an ArrayList of Integers (the parameter).  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution. </p>
