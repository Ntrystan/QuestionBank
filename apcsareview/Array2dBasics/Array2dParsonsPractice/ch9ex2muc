   The following program segment should create a 8 by 8 two-dimensional int array. It should fill this array with a checkered pattern of 0s and 1s -- starting with a 1 in the top left corner and print the output (in row-column order).  But, the blocks have been mixed up and include <b>one extra block</b> that is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right.  Click the <i>Check Me</i> button to check your solution.</p>

   int[][] checkerboard = new int[8][8];

   for (int row = 0; row < checkerboard.length; row++) {
       for (int col = 0; col < checkerboard[row].length; col++) {
