   :answer_a: result = int1 - int2;
   :answer_b: int1 -= int2;
   :answer_c: int1.subtract(int2);
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: While the syntax here is correct, there's an even simpler way to execute subtraction that doesn't create a new variable.
   :feedback_b: The "-=" syntax correct subtracts int2 from int1, without creating an additional variable, which is ideal in our solution for this problem.
   :feedback_c: Because the pixels are of primitive type "int,"  there is not subtract() method which can be executed in this case.

   Which is the simplest way to subtract one integer value from another integer value?
