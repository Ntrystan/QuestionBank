   :feedback_a: The size of outer array is the number of rows.  Remember that two-dimensional arrays are actually an array of arrays in Java.
   :feedback_b: The size of the inner array is the number of columns.
   :feedback_c: This is the total number of items in the array.

   How many columns does ``a`` have if it is created as follows ``int[][] a = { {2, 4, 6, 8}, {1, 2, 3, 4} };``?
