    What does the following code print when ``x`` has been set to 187?

    .. code-block:: java

        if (x < 0)
        {
            System.out.println("x is negative");
        }
        else if (x == 0)
        {
            System.out.println("x is zero");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("x is positive");
        }

    -   x is negative

        -   This will only print if x has been set to a number less than zero. Has it?

    -   x is zero

        -   This will only print if x has been set to 0.  Has it?

    -   x is positive

        +   The first condition is false and ``x`` is not equal to zero so the else
            will execute.
